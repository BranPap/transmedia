Singer Macy Gray Pushes Back Against ‘Transphobic’ Accusations: ‘I Don’t Know What It Means to Be a Trans Woman’

R&B singer Macy Gray is being accused of “transphobia” after saying “just because you go change your parts doesn’t make you a woman.” The singer responded to the attacks, tweeting that she was simply defining the word “women.”

“I wasn’t defining trans women. Just women. Because I know what it means to be one. I don’t know what it means to be a trans woman and never said I did. But that goes both ways,” Gray wrote in a since deleted tweet, according to a report by Fox News.

Gray came under fire Monday after telling Piers Morgan that a woman is “a human being with boobs — and a vagina.”

“I will say this — and everybody’s going to hate me — but as a woman, just because you go change your parts doesn’t make a woman. Sorry,” Gray added. “I know that for a fact.”

"What women go through is a completely unique experience and surgery or finding yourself doesn't change that."

“If you want me to call you a ‘her,’ I will, because that’s what you want. But that doesn’t make you a woman, just because I call you a ‘her’ and just because you got a surgery,” the singer continued.

“Women go through just a completely unique experience. And surgery or finding yourself doesn’t change that. Being a little girl is a whole epic book, and you can’t have that just because you want to be a woman,” Gray affirmed.

After Morgan pointed out that she might get called “transphobic” for saying these things, the singer said, “But it’s the truth, and I don’t think you should be called transphobic just because you don’t agree.”

“There’s a lot of judgment and throwing stones at people for just saying what it is,” she added.

In a statement to Fox News Digital on Tuesday, Gray said that she has “nothing but love for the LGBTQ+ and transgender community, and have been a supporter since day one.”

“My statement on Piers Morgan was grossly misunderstood,” the singer added. “I don’t hate anyone. I respect everyone’s right to feel comfortable in their bodies and live their own truth.”

Transgender and left-wing activists called Gray “ignorant,” “transphobic,” and a “TERF” (transgender-exclusionary radical feminist), which refers to feminists who do not include biological men who think they are women in their women’s rights advocacy.
