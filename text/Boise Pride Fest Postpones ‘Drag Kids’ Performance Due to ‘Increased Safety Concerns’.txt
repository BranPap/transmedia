Boise Pride Fest Postpones ‘Drag Kids’ Performance Due to ‘Increased Safety Concerns’

The annual Boise Pride Fest, slated to take place September 9-11, has postponed its “Drag Kids” performance after it caught the national spotlight, although the group is citing “increased safety concerns” — not the inappropriate nature of the event itself.

The original festival proudly advertised a children’s drag show, describing it as a “show like none other” featuring children as young as 11 years old.

It remains unclear if that group will cancel the child drag show performance as well as the date draws closer.
