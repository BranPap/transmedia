Twenty-Nine-Year-Old Man Identifying as Woman Beats Teen Girl at Skateboarding Tournament: ‘It’s Madness’

A 29-year-old man living as a woman beat a 13-year-old girl for first place during a skateboarding tournament recently in New York City, and social media users had strong opinions about it.

“In second place was Shiloh Catori, a 13-year-old girl who is 133 in the Boardr Global Ranks, which are based on performance in skateboarding competitions. Tres, by comparison, sits at 838 in the rankings,” the outlet said.

“I thought it was unfair at the time. I was really uncomfortable,” Silverman explained in reference to competing against a trans athlete, adding she went through the motions and tried to be a good sportsman.

She continued, “But the more that I sat with it and thought about it, the more I felt like I needed to say something. Because I recognize that this is an issue bigger than skateboarding. This is impacting all different sports and girls and women on all levels.”
