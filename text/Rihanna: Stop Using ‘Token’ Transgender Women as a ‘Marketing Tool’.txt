Rihanna: Stop Using ‘Token’ Transgender Women as a ‘Marketing Tool’

Rihanna called on companies to stop using “token” transgender women as a “marketing tool,” during an alleged private message to a fan this week.

“I’ve had the pleasure of working with many gifted trans women throughout the years, but I don’t go around doing trans castings! Just like I don’t do straight non trans women castings!” wrote Rihanna in a private Twitter message to a fan, after they asked her to include a trans woman in her campaign. “I respect all women, and whether they’re trans or not is none of my business! It’s personal and some trans women are more comfortable being open about it than others so I have to respect that as a woman myself!”

“I don’t think it’s fair that a trans woman, or man, be used as a convenient marketing tool,” she continued, adding, ” Too often do I see companies doing this to trans and black women alike! There’s always just that one spot in the campaign for the token ‘we look mad diverse’ girl/guy! It’s sad!”

Last week, Barbie attempted to turn the LGBT community into its marketing department by publishing photographs of two “Love Wins” dolls to their Instagram account.

The photos, which currently have over 80,000 likes combined, prompted prominent LGBT news outlets, including Pink News, to praise the company, declaring, “We’re massive fans of LGBT-rights Barbie and you should be too.”
