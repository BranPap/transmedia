Woman Alarmed Ross Department Store Allowed Man to Use Women’s Dressing Room

A shocked female customer of a Ross department store in Texas is criticizing a manager’s decision to allow a man to use the women’s changing room earlier this week.

Lisa Stickles of Forney, Texas, reported that she was in the changing room of the store and was surprised to hear a man’s voice. She then told the manager of the experience, but the manager did not seem to care.

“She went inside the dressing room, came right back out and called me to the side and told me … he was representing himself as a woman today,” Stickles told Dallas/Fort Worth’s CBS affiliate.

A corporate spokesman for Ross told the media it had no comment on the specific incident but “does not discriminate” against transgender people.

That was not good enough for Stickles, however. “What about me? Or my feelings?” she asked.

“(The manager) told me that if I felt uncomfortable in the dressing room with him there … I’d have to wait until he’s finished,” she added.

The customer apparently did not believe the man was transgender. “He was in no way dressed as a woman,” she said. “He had on jeans, a t-shirt, 5 o’clock shadow, very deep voice. He was a man.”

The customer’s worry evokes shadows of the argument many make against these pro-transgender policies. If the woman’s story is to be believed, a man who had not attempted to observe a transgender lifestyle simply decided to use the women’s changing room for a seemingly illegitimate reason.
