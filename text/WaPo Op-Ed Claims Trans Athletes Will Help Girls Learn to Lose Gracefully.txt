WaPo Op-Ed Claims Trans Athletes Will Help Girls Learn to Lose Gracefully

An op-ed in the Washington Post has argued that men in women‚Äôs sports could actually be a good thing for young girls by teaching them the art of losing gracefully.

According to Alyssa Rosenberg, the aim of school athletics is not to teach children the art of achieving excellence but rather to build character, and what better way to build character in a teenage girl than having her experience the frustration of losing that championship title to a biological male? Her argument largely hinges on the unicorn of ‚Äúsports-crazed parents‚Äù who will theoretically use transgender athletes in women‚Äôs sports as an excuse in the event their daughter loses.

‚ÄúWhy fake an athletic r√©sum√© or sue the varsity coach when you can simply accuse a girl who bested your daughter of being secretly transgender?‚Äù Rosenberg ponders.
