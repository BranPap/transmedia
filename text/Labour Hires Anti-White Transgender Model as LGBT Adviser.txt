Labour Hires Anti-White Transgender Model as LGBT Adviser

The UK’s left-wing Labour Party has hired transgender model Munroe Bergdorf, who was fired from L’Oreal following a racist rant against white people last year, as an adviser.

“Thrilled to announce that I’ve been asked to be part of an LGBT+ advisory board for The Labour Party – To advise Shadow Secretary of State for Women and Equalities, Dawn Butler MP, on issues affecting the LGBT+ community,” declared Bergdorf in a post on Twitter, where she was verified last month, despite Twitter’s claims that it would no longer verify those who engage in racism.

Bergdorf was also pictured standing next to Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party.

In a statement, Dawn Butler MP’s office added, “Dawn is proud to stand with those challenging discrimination… Dawn will consult with the LGBT advisory group on a wide-range of LGBT issues.”

Bergdorf, a transgender woman, was fired from L’Oreal last year after she published a rant against white people on Facebook, calling whites “the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth.”

“Your existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour. Your entire existence is drenched in racism,” the model continued, before doubling down on the comments in an interview.

Following the announcement this week of Bergdorf’s employment, Conservative Party MP Helen Grant criticized the appointment in a letter to Butler.

“I am writing to you to express my concern regarding your appointment of Munroe Bergdorf as an adviser on equality issues – and to urge you to reconsider,” expressed Grant. “You’ll be well aware Munroe’s controversial comments in the past which saw her sacked from L’Oreal, including stating that the ‘entire existence’ of white people is drenched in racism. Of white people, she stated: ‘Your existence, privilege, and success as a race is drenched in racism.'”

The letter continued:

At the time, L’Oreal released a statement which outlined how the company ‘supports diversity and tolerance towards all people irrespective of their race, background, gender, or religion’, and that Bergdorf’s comments are ‘at odds with those values’.

This is clearly concerning language and does nothing for community cohesion. Since her appointment as an adviser to you on equality issues, further deeply concerning comments have come to light, including:

There really is no excuse for these abhorrent slurs and, fundamentally, they damage the campaign to promote equality and diversity across public life.

When Jeremy Corbyn was elected Labour leader, he promised a ‘kinder politics’. Yet it seems every day we see some new example of abuse from the Labour Party. The kind of language Bergdorf has used has no place in public life, and ought to be condemned by all those who are serious about promoting equality.

I urge you to reconsider your appointment of Munroe Bergdorf in light of these comments, and would be pleased to meet with you to discuss further how we can really progress the cause of equalities.
