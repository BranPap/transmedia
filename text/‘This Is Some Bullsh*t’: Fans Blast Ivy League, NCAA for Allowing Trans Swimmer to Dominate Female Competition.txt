‘This Is Some Bullsh*t’: Fans Blast Ivy League, NCAA for Allowing Trans Swimmer to Dominate Female Competition

University of Pennsylvania transgender swimmer Lia Thomas smashed the women’s 500-yard freestyle record at the Ivy League Championships Thursday while cruising to a first-place finish.

As Breitbart’s Warner Todd Huston reported via the New York Post, “Thomas, who is a man and competed as a man for nearly three years on the school’s men’s swim team, won the 500-yard race against a field of women with an unheard of time of 4:37.32, the best time ever recorded at Harvard University’s Blodgett Pool.”

Video of the trans swimmer’s domination quickly began making the rounds on the internet.

It wasn’t long after that video was posted that Twitter users unleashed a torrent of criticism directed at Thomas, the NCAA, and the Ivy League. Chiefly, people were upset that these organizations allowed a male swimmer to compete against and dominate female competitors while enjoying an obvious physical advantage.

90% of people know it's bullshit, they're just afraid to say it.

500 free final @IvyLeague championships: Lia Thomas, formerly of the @PennSwimDive men's team, won by over 7 seconds. You can hardly see the other women swimming at the far end of the pool by the time the race is over. For the women, "it was a race for second place." pic.twitter.com/3ItZnsGMtR

Lia Thomas is a biological male swimming against biological females. Whether she identifies as a girl is irrelevant to the fact that she was born a male, went through puberty as a male, and swam on the mens team for 3 years. Protect women’s sports.

ESPN weighed in with a startling grasp of the obvious. Though, they stopped short of saying exactly why Thomas enjoyed such a strength advantage over the rest of the field:

.@ESPN: "You can see the …powerful stroke of Lia Thomas where there isn't a whole lot of movement in her legs. …it's a much quieter stroke even though it's more powerful than a lot of these other swimmers right now."  @SaveWomensSport @AbigailShrier @KDansky @coachblade pic.twitter.com/fOr3piBep6

Congratulations to Catherine Buroker, who might have come second in this race, but as she lost to trans woman Lia Thomas (born a man) Catherine is the real winner here 👏🏻🏊‍♀️ https://t.co/TgnPDn4mML

UPenn swimmer “Lia” Thomas is just a horrible human being.

He knows he’s destroying the sport for women, but the mentally ill spoiled brat couldn’t care less. 

Shame on the @NCAA for destroying the championship and erasing all the hard work real women put in.

The “scrutiny” you’re referring to is noticing that Lia Thomas is not a woman competing in women’s events. https://t.co/bDLEKyWgHI

Lia Thomas is cheating. https://t.co/tEbXQgyZha

Genuine question. Because it only takes one Lia Thomas in each event for women's sports to be meaningless, long-standing records trashed. This is the future, so the LGBT-lobby who have pushed this through need to think of an answer #whatdowesaytothegirls
