Judge Upholds Chicago School’s Transgender Policy: Anti-Discrimination Statutes ‘Broader than Based Only on Genitalia or Chromosome’

A Chicago federal judge has refused to order a suburban Chicago school district to suspend their transgender bathroom policy.

According to NBC News, the transgender bathroom policy “enables transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice,” and has prompted legal action from more than 50 families in the Palatine, Illinois, school district.

U.S. District Judge Jorge Alonso concluded “that decades-old anti-discrimination statutes extend to students whose gender identity isn’t conventional,” NBC News reported, and declared that the courts have “correctly recognized” that “federal protections against sex discrimination are substantially broader than based only on genitalia or chromosome.”

The judge’s decision was made in response to more than 50 families who filed a lawsuit “in hopes of getting the Township High School District 211 in Palatine, just northwest of Chicago, to end the policy for good.”

Gary McCaleb, the lead attorney for the families against the policy, declared Tuesday that an appeal is likely, claiming, “It’s not a defeat until the Supreme Court rules the wrong way. And I don’t think they will.”

The lawsuit is one of several currently take place in the United States, where some families are expressing safety and privacy concerns in response to school policies that allow transgender students to use the bathroom and locker-rooms of their choice.
