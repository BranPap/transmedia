Biological Male ‚ÄòAbsolutely Demolishes‚Äô Female Surfing Competitors in Australia

A biological man who had been a prize-winning surfer as a man is now suddenly dominating women‚Äôs surfing competitions in Australia after claiming to be transgender.

On Sunday, Sasha Jane Lowerson, who previously competed as Ryan Egan, won Australia‚Äôs 2022 West Coast Suspensions Longboard & Logger State Championships, beating the closest natural-born female competitor by four points, Outkick noted.

Lowerson competed as Ryan Egan as recently as 2019 when he won the same championship in the men‚Äôs division. And Egan/Lowerson has now become the first person to win both the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs championships in Australia.

Many people are outraged by the situation, saying that Egan/Lowerson‚Äôs achievements seem to be perfect proof of how unfair it is for transgender women to compete against natural-born women.

I know pro's in the skateboading industry who are refusing to speak up for female athletes even though they privately complain about what's going on

its time to speak up

Males competing in women's division is the ultimate chauvinistic fuck you. The 43-year-old Sasha Jane Lowerson, who was crowned the men‚Äôs champion three years ago, just won both the Open Women‚Äôs and Open Logger divisions in Australia, by obliterating the "competition". pic.twitter.com/KhzuHfGmQl

Here in Australia, Sasha Jane Lowerson just won the womens longboard event for surfing.

Look at the difference in times. If Sasha had competed in the mens event, he would have won fair and square. Instead he took Georgia‚Äôs 1st place, denied Sam her 2nd, and Shae‚Äôs 3rd pic.twitter.com/KLQBdAf33P

Now the man, Sasha Jane Lowerson, is on there. Nice work, Sasha! You're a man, a cheat, & a misogynist.

Check out the other blokes who've competed in women's sports & marvel at how few women who identify as men compete in men's sports. #transwomenaremen#sashajanelowerson https://t.co/z0MrLbTxVR
