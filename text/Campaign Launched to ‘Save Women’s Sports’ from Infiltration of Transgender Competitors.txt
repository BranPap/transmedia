Campaign Launched to ‘Save Women’s Sports’ from Infiltration of Transgender Competitors

A new effort has been launched to stop transgender “women,” biological males, from competing against natural-born female athletes.

The website SaveWomensSports.com tells visitors that the organization “seeks to preserve biology-based eligibility standards for participation on female sports.”

A section of the website lists a growing number of men who claim to be women, entering various sporting events as transgender woman and often overpower all natural-born female opponents.

The group’s founder, Beth Stelzer, recently spoke to the Heritage Foundation to discuss how gender identity is destroying the fair playing field for women’s sports by allowing men claiming to be transgender to compete as women.

“They bully women while claiming to be victims of bullying,” said Stelzer. “Women are afraid if we speak up we will lose our sponsorships, opportunities, relationships, and even our jobs.” If men are allowed to compete in women’s’ sports, “there will be no longer women’s sports,” Stelzer added.

“I do not want to see girls who are playing soccer who are tough face pressure to adopt gender ideology and say they are boys,” Stelzer said.

The website adds: “‘The transgender ideology will erase opportunities for women and girls in sports, and may try to redefine strong girls as masculine and therefore as men,’ said Jennifer Bryson, founder of Let All Play.”
