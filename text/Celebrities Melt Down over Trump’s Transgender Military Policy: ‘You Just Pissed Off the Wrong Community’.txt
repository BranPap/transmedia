Celebrities Melt Down over Trump’s Transgender Military Policy: ‘You Just Pissed Off the Wrong Community’

Hollywood stars took to social media Wednesday to express outrage over President Donald Trump’s announcement that transgender people will not be allowed to serve in the U.S. military, reversing former President Obama’s decision last year allowing them to do so.

“After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,” President Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. “Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical cost and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.”

The news spurred some stars to viciously attack the president, with some calling Trump a cruel bigot.

Star Trek actor and gay activist George Takei sent what appeared to be a threat to Trump, warning that he “just pissed off the wrong community” and said the president “will regret” this action.

Donald: With your ban on trans people from the military, you are on notice that you just pissed off the wrong community. You will regret it.

— George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) July 26, 2017

Takei also tweeted: “History shall record that you are not only the stupidest, most incompetent president ever, but also the cruelest and pettiest. #Shame.” The actor also issued a call to action:

Invidious discrimination against any group must be opposed by all. Straight/Cis allies: Will you stand with LGBTs?#TransRightsAreHumanRights

Director Paul Feig called Trump’s decision “disgraceful,” while noted Trump-basher and actor Rob Reiner called the president a “hateful human being.”

Below is a roundup of the rage Hollywood stars sent toward President Trump in the wake of his announcement.

Merely *existing* as trans in this world is heroic. This week, we might serve trans friends/family best by protecting their healthcare.

We should be grateful to the people who wish to serve, not turn our backs on them. Banning transgender people is hurtful, baseless and wrong
