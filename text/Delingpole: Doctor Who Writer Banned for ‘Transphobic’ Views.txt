Delingpole: Doctor Who Writer Banned for ‘Transphobic’ Views

Woke Doctor Who fans have had a Doctor Who writer removed from a short story collection because he holds incorrect views about transgender issues.

Why am I not surprised?

I’m so old that I can actually remember a time when Doctor Who was a children’s TV programme rather than a political indoctrination class for budding Social Justice Warriors.

But, as we know, that Tardis flew long ago.

Even as long ago as 2005, Doctor Who was eagerly introducing us to possibly UK kiddy TV’s first out bisexual — Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman).

Then, it went a step further by explaining to us that actually Captain Jack is not really bisexual because in the future everyone has realised that sexuality is just a social construct so people can date whoever they want…

Since then, Doctor Who has successfully managed to shed large numbers of viewers by turning every episode into a United Colours of Benetton advert in which even Victorian England is depicted as a paradigm of diversity (“history’s a whitewash” we were told), by making every other character gay or disabled,  and by ensuring that Doctor Who himself has had all his toxic masculinity removed by being turned into a woman.

Now, Doctor Who fans have taken this wokeness to whole new levels by sacking one of its writers from a short story collection — as a punishment for holding incorrect views on transgender people.

Gareth Roberts, an award-winning Doctor Who writer, has described his experiences on Medium:

So, since That Doctor Who Writer's blogged about it: I’m a contributor who questioned GR’s inclusion in the anthology, on account of him being a vocal transphobe, amongst some other views he found in the bin. (I don’t know if any of the other writers were involved.)

Susie — ‘I write heartfelt, funny books for children and young adults, including the Pea’s Book series and the Secrets’ — appears to make up in aggressive wokeness what she lacks in talent.

Who is going to rescue our civilisation from the growing threat posed by Susie Day and her fellow Daemons of Woke?

Not Doctor Who, clearly. She’s now part of the problem…
