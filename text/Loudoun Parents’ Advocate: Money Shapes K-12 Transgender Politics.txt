Loudoun Parents’ Advocate: Money Shapes K-12 Transgender Politics

“Some of the companies out there that are pushing this [Critical Race Theory] stuff in schools are making a ton of money,” Prior stated.



The Equity Collective describes itself as an organization pursuing “the dismantling of inequitable social structures.” Its website list pronouns for its staffers following their names and profiles.

The Equity Collective’s staff’s profile use terms such as “structural racism,” “social and restorative justice,” “queer,” “anti-gender-based violence,” “racial equity and liberation,” “non-Black POC,” “ancestral healing,” “intersectional justice,” “internalized racism,” “racial justice,”

The Equity Collective’s website does not list prices for its programming.

Prior noted that teachers opposed to the imposition of Critical Race Theory upon children are fearful to express their views.

He said, “We run into lots of teachers that say, I am with you 100 percent, but I’m afraid to sign [your petitions] because of repercussions. I would say well over 150 times we’ve gotten that response. I think that there is a silent majority of teachers there that do support what we’re doing. It’s just difficult for them to come out because it’s their livelihood at stake.”

“We hear from teachers all the time,” he added. “They’re the ones that have to teach some of the stuff that they’re being trained on with the Critical Race Theory concepts and the overly sexualized materials that are in the libraries or in the classrooms. Teachers just aren’t for that.”
