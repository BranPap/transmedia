Children’s National Hospital Denies Providing ‘Gender-Affirming’ Surgery for Minors Despite Audio Indicating Otherwise

Children’s National Hospital in Washington, DC, is following in lockstep with Boston Children’s Hospital via coverup and denial, claiming that it does not provide “gender-affirming” surgeries for minors, despite audio clearly indicating otherwise.

Workers at the hospital admitted in audio, which has since gone viral on social media, that it will perform a “gender-affirming” hysterectomy on a 16-year-old child. When pressed further, a hospital worker stated that she has seen the procedures done on children even younger than 15.

When asked the youngest age they would perform that surgery, the woman said, “I’m not sure, but I have seen younger kids. And I’m not, you know, due to HIPAA, I’m not allowed to say that, but I have seen younger kids.”

Further, the hospital’s website originally stated that it offered “gender-affirming medical care and gender-affirming” hysterectomies for children and teens. It later removed that from the website and on Thursday posted a statement following the viral status of the audio.

“We are aware of the audio recording circulating on Twitter,” the hospital said before offering the “facts.”
