NCAA Removes 7 Championships from NC Due to Bathroom Law

The NCAA removed seven previously scheduled championship events from North Carolina for the upcoming academic year because of the state’s bathroom law.

“Based on the NCAA’s commitment to fairness and inclusion, the Association will relocate all seven previously awarded championship events from North Carolina during the 2016-17 academic year,” the collegiate athletics governing body explained in a release. “The NCAA Board of Governors made this decision because of the cumulative actions taken by the state concerning civil rights protections.”

House Bill 2 restricts multiple-occupancy public restrooms in state buildings to people of the sex indicated on the entrances. Transgender individuals claim that the law unfairly discriminates against them.

The contests pulled from the state include Division 1 women’s soccer, golf, and lacrosse championships, and first- and second-round games in the men’s basketball tournament.

The NCAA also cited restrictions by New York, Minnesota, Washington, Vermont, and Connecticut on public employees traveling to the Tar Heel State, among other reasons, to justify the removal of the events.

“Fairness is about more than the opportunity to participate in college sports, or even compete for championships,” NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a release. “We believe in providing a safe and respectful environment at our events and are committed to providing the best experience possible for college athletes, fans and everyone taking part in our championships.”
