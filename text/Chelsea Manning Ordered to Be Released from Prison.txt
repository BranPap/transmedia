Chelsea Manning Ordered to Be Released from Prison

A judge has ordered the release of former soldier Chelsea Manning because federal officials no longer need Manning’s evidence for the investigation against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.

The decision came a day after Manning reportedly attempted suicide. Manning was put in detention after the former soldier refused to testify against Assange, who posted secret information that was leaked to him by Manning.

In 2013, Manning was convicted of providing classified data to Assange and was sentenced to 35 years in jail by a military court. President Barack Obama subsequently released Manning in 2017.
