D.C. Public School Students Now Allowed to Identify as ‘Non-Binary’

Public school students in Washington D.C. are now allowed to identify as “non-binary” instead of male or female, according to a report.

A report from the Washington Post claims that a new policy will allow public school students in Washington D.C. to identify as “non-binary.” The term refers to the theory that gender exists on a spectrum. “Non-binary” individuals claim that their gender exists outside of the traditional “male” and “female” categories.

The policy, which is set to go into effect next fall, was designed in response to President Trump’s attempt to limit federal recognition of transgender individuals.
