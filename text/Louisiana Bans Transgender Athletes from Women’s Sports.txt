Louisiana Bans Transgender Athletes from Women’s Sports

The state of Louisiana has now officially banned biological males from competing in women’s sports.

The Fairness in Women’s Sports Act passed the Republican-led state legislature and became law after Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards agreed to neither approve nor veto the bill.

Recently, transgender golfer Mianne Bagger, a man living as a woman who made history by competing in the Women’s Australian Open after transitioning in 1995, recently said it’s “utter rubbish” that “male-bodied” transgender athletes are being allowed to compete alongside women in professional sports.

“Male-bodied people presenting as women, who live as women, with varying degrees of medical intervention and in some degrees, no medical intervention, which is just — it’s crossed the line, in my view, it really has … It’s a slap in the face to women,” Bagger told News.com.au.
