California Democrats Troll State of the Union with Impeachment Ads, ‘Dreamers’ in Gallery

California Democrats are planning to troll President Donald Trump’s first official State of the Union address on Tuesday evening, cementing the Golden State’s leadership of the so-called “Resistance” to his administration.

First-term Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), a leading contender for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2020, will bring a so-called “Dreamer” — an illegal alien who came to the country as a minor — to the gallery as her guest.

The San Francisco Chronicle notes: “Sen. Kamala Harris will bring Denea Joseph, a Belize native and member of UndocuBlack, which seeks to raise awareness that black people are also among the undocumented population, not just Asians and Latinos.”

At least three other California Democrats in the House will be bringing beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which expires in early March, according to the Press Enterprise.

The Chronicle adds that Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) will be wearing black in solidarity with the #metoo campaign, and Rep. Jared Huffman (D-CA) will be bringing a transgender Marine veteran to protest Trump’s proposed ban on transgender soldiers.

Meanwhile, left-wing billionaire Tom Steyer will be running ads promoting the impeachment of the president during the address.

“The new ad is tightly focused on a ticking clock and features Steyer giving examples of the kind of damage a president could do in 30 seconds: order the deportation of immigrant children, threaten an unstable dictator, and ‘go into a rage’ and use the nuclear launch codes,” the Los Angeles Times reports.

California is considered a key battleground state in the 2018 midterm elections, as Democrats hope to pick up several seats towards the required total of 24 to flip the House of Representatives.
