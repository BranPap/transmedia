Poll: Most Voters Support Florida Bill Banning Inappropriate Classroom Discussions for K-3

Most voters support Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Bill, which protects children in kindergarten through third grade from classroom discussions on gender identity and sexual orientation, a Rasmussen Reports survey released Thursday found.

The survey found that three-fourths of voters have followed news about the measure, which the left has grossly mischaracterized with the cheap, inaccurate slogan, “Don’t Say Gay,” even though the word “gay” does not appear in the bill’s text. In reality, the bill asserts that “classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.”

When asked about the bill in an honest manner, a majority of voters support it. Rasmussen Reports asked:

The relevant passage of the new Florida law reads: “Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.” Would you support or oppose such a law in your state?

When given the full context, 62 percent of voters say they would support a similar law in their state, and of those, 45 percent said they would “strongly” support it.
