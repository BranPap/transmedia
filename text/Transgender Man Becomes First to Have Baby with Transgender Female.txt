Transgender Man Becomes First to Have Baby with Transgender Female

A transgender couple became the first to have their own child when a transgender man gave birth to a baby boy.

Fernando Machado, who used to be a woman, and Diane Rodriguez, who used to be a man, were able to have the baby because neither had undergone corrective surgery, Express reports.

“Our son is not only a blessing, but he also promotes love,” the couple wrote in a Facebook post that included a photo of their newborn son.

“Being a mother was never something I thought I would do because I am a transsexual,” Rodriguez said. “The law before demanded that to be recognized as a woman you had to be castrated.”

Rodriguez made headlines back in 2013 when she became the first transgender candidate to run for public office in Ecuador.

The couple met on social media two years ago.

“We are the same as other families,” Rodriguez said. “Even though we might not have the same rights, we’re the same.”

Machado, when he found out he was pregnant, became overwhelmed with a host of emotions.

”I had never felt like that before,” Machado said. “Wow, at last, I am completely happy.”

The couple is one of the most high-profile transgender couples in South America.
