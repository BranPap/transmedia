Roughly 40 LGBTQ Texans Running for Office in 2018, Says Community Mag

Houston Magazine OutSmart reports that at least 35 LGBTQ Texans are running for office in the 2018 primary and general elections–including governor and lieutenant governor contests. Five candidates identify as transgender. More than one-third are from Harris County. The publication added five to the list by Wednesday afternoon.

The publication began the article by stating:

With equality under attack by the Trump administration and the Texas Legislature, LGBTQ candidates across the state are lining up to fight back.

There are LGBTQ candidates in Texas Senate (3) and House (10) races, and eight are running for Congress. One of the named candidates is running to be a Texas Supreme Court justice, and 14 for other judicial races. The LGBTQ magazine based in Houston said they conducted “an extensive review” to arrive at the number of LGBTQ candidates. They called it an “unprecedented field”– twice as many as in any election cycle in the Lone Star State’s history, they say.

The CEO of Equality Texas, Chuck Smith, was reported to tell OutSmart, “I think for many, the motivation to run is in sync with the adage, ‘If you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu.’”

Twenty of the candidates are female and, 20 are male, and six of these candidates are running for reelection. Most of the candidates are Democrats, but one is running for lieutenant governor as a Libertarian and two are running in the Republican primary.

LGBTQ candidates in the Republican primary include a challenger, Shannon McClendon, who is running against what the magazine calls “anti-LGBTQ incumbent state Senator Donna Campbell” (R-New Braunfels). Mauro Garza is running in open Congressional District 21. Republican Rep. Lamar Smith from San Antonio is retiring.

Jess Herbst, reported to be “the state’s only trans elected official,” is running for nonpartisan reelection in the New Hope mayoral race. Trans woman Vanessa Edwards Foster is one of the many Democrats running in Congressional District 27 (vacated by Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold from Corpus Christi).

Three of the candidates are African-American, and eight are Hispanic, including “out lesbian” Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez, the magazine reported. Jeffrey Payne is also a Democratic candidate for governor. The magazine reported that Payne “became the subject of national media attention due in part to his status as the owner of a leather bar in Dallas.”

Thirteen of the candidates are from Harris County. Cooke Kelsey is running for judge and told OutSmart, “[Former Houston Mayor] Annise Parker opened the door for us, and I’m honored to have her endorsement.” The judicial candidate also said, “I haven’t felt this excited about change since when I dropped everything to work on the first Obama campaign.” Kelsey added, “But as recent cases show, our issues are still front and center. We owe it to ourselves to keep running and help bring Texas into the modern era.”

OutSmart reported that some of the candidates they contacted did not want to be publicly identified as LGBTQ.

“This time around, I’m not running that kind of race, so I don’t have a place for the gay agenda, and I don’t want to participate.” The county-level candidate wrote in response to an OutSmart inquiry: “In a year and a half, I may be running for another office, and we can talk then.”

Another candidate said they weren’t sure that they wanted to publicly discuss an issue when “I haven’t totally addressed it privately.” OutSmart reported that there are currently 18 LGBTQ elected and appointed officials in Texas.
