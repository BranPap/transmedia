Pakistan: Police Refuse to Press Charges After Extortionist Burns Transgender Alive

A racketeer allegedly protected by police in Pakistan, where many revile the LGBT community as abhorrent to Islam, doused a transgender individual with alcohol and “set him on fire” for failing to pay extortion money on time, Dawn learned from the victim’s brother.

Aqeel Ahmad’s brother Khalil Ahmad identified the attacker only as Faisal, adding that local police refused to file the heinous incident.

“Instead, they forced my brother to sign and give his thumb impressions on a statement that says he caught fire when the stove in his kitchen burst,” declared Khalil.

Aqeel reportedly managed to survive the ordeal, which took place in Pakistan’s Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area.

The Holy Family Hospital in Rawalpindi, reportedly established by a Christian organization, treated his injuries.

“Admitted at the Holy Family Hospital, Aqeel told Khalil that the accused works as an extortionist and allegedly has the protection of the area police,” notes Dawn. “Aqeel also said that Faisal rushed him to the hospital to deceive hospital officials regarding his involvement in the incident.”

The Rawalpindi City Police Office (CPO) is reportedly investigating the matter.

Last year, some Pakistanis, defying the various anti-LGBT jihadist groups and other Islamic extremists that operate in the country, took to the streets to angrily protest the shooting of a transgender activist.

In June 2016, the Telegraph reported that Pakistani “officials are accused of turning a blind eye to a surge in violence against the marginalized community.”

“Transgenders appear to be facing some of the worst attacks,” it adds. “Activists say 45 transgender people have been killed in the northern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) region in the past two years.”

The KP region is a known epicenter of Taliban and al-Qaeda activity and a training ground for jihadists. 

While some Pakistani media outlets such as the prominent Ummat newspaper, cheered the June 2016 massacre at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida, with a headline that says, “Afghan Youth Roasts 50 Americans,” some people in the country gathered for vigils to remember and honor the victims of the terrorist attack.

Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old American citizen of Afghan descent, killed 49 people and wounded 53 others before he was executed by police.
