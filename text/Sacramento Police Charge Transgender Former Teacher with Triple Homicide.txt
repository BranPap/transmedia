Sacramento Police Charge Transgender Former Teacher with Triple Homicide

A former teacher-turned-transgender woman and LGBT activist who sued a California school district for discrimination has been arrested and accused of a triple homicide, police report.

Oakland police arrested Dana Rivers, 61, of San Jose in connection with a triple murder. Dead are Patricia Wright, 57, Charlotte Reed, 56, and 19-year-old Toto Diambu, found stabbed and shot to death in a home on November 11.

Officials arrested Rivers on three counts of murder, arson, and possession of metal knuckles, according to the Sacramento Bee.

Police say that after murdering the three victims, Rivers set the Oakland home on fire at about 12:30 a.m. on Friday, November 11.

Rivers was discovered with a gun, ammunition, and a knife used in the murder, according to police reports.

Officials offered no motive for the crime.

Media outlets quickly discovered that the suspect was once named David Warfield, a teacher at Center High School in Antelope, California. In the 1990s, Warfield began to transition into a female and eventually sued the school system for discrimination.

After an earlier announcement of his intention to transition into a woman, Warfield was suspended from teaching in 1999 and soon sued because of the school system’s decision. Later going by the name Dana Rivers, the former teacher won a $150,000 settlement from the school system.
