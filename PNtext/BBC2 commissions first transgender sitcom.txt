BBC2 commissions first transgender sitcom

BBC2 has commissioned the first transgender sitcom in Britain, which was selected following a talent search.

‘Boy Meets Girl’ is described as a “funny, sensitive and progressive” romantic comedy, and features a developing relationship between characters Leo, 26 and Judy, 40.

The character Judy is a trans woman and is played by transgender actress Rebecca Root.

The script was created by Elliott Kerrigan, and was discovered through the Trans Comedy Award, which last year offered up to £5,000 for script writers which promoted the positive portrayal of transgender characters.

The sitcom, set in and around Manchester, is described as of the same vein as Gavin and Stacey, and hopes to find mainstream success.

Actor Root works as a specialist voice coach, assisting trans people find their voice.
