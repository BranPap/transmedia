York Pride honours memory of transgender singer Chrisie Edkins in charity fundraiser

A donation has been made to the Beaumont Society in memory of a popular transgender singer and entertainer.

Chrisie Edkins, from Hampshire, died on 10 June just weeks after performing at this year’s York Pride.

The Chair of York Pride, Greg Stephenson, said: “We were delighted to have such a high profile trans performer as part of our line-up. The trans community can be the forgotten element of Pride celebrations and Chrisie Edkins was a wonderful representative and a great entertainer. We are incredibly sad to hear of her passing.”

Upon hearing the news of Chrisie’s death, York Pride organised a special club night at York’s Vanity venue, with all door funds going towards the Beaumont Society.

The Society is the largest and longest established transgender support group in the UK.

Chrisie’s death is not being treated as suspicious and is being investigated by the mid-Hampshire coroner’s office as a suspected suicide.

Her family said Chrisie had struggled to cope with personal issues in her life that were not connected to her transgender campaigning.

She leaves behind two daughters.
