Ireland: Transgender groups hail victory in gender recognition battle

The Transgender Equality Network Ireland has welcomed a settlement between the Irish government and a trans woman, bringing gender recognition into law.

Dr Foy, a 67-year-old dentist, first launched proceedings in the 1990s, arguing for her right to a female birth certificate and legal gender recognition.

Her battle spanned three decades, and three separate cases across innumerable courts – but this week she announced the government had announced an “expressed intention” to introduce a Gender Recognition Bill, which would recognise trans people in all dealings with the State, public bodies, and civil and commercial society.

“Legal recognition is vital to improving the daily lives of trans people in Ireland.

“This is a significant step forward in ending Dr Lydia Foy’s twenty year struggle to be legally recognised in her true gender. 

“And it is a significant step forward for our entire community who will be able to avail of the legislation in 2015. 

“Now that there is a firm timeline for the legislation, it’s imperative that the Government review the content of this legislation.

“It’s not enough to have a law. The Government now has the opportunity to enact human rights based legislation that fully protects the dignity and autonomy of all trans and intersex people in Ireland.”
