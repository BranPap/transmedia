Dancer sacked from Chinese talent show because she’s transgender

A famous Chinese dancer says she was dropped as a judge on a TV talent show because she is transgender.

Jin Xing, 44, had sex reassignment surgery in 1996. She was booked to appear for eight weeks on Feitong Fanxiang, a show for professional singers.

She told China Daily that the show’s director, Chao Chi-tai, called her personally to say that government officials had demanded for her to be axed from the show.

Jin claimed that Chao, quoting from an official document from culture officials in Zhejiang province, said her “transgender identity could have negative effects on society”.

The dancer says she is not interested in compensation or an apology. 

“I’m just angry that the officials used such a lame excuse. It’s a personal attack,” she said.

The Zhejiang province culture department has not commented.
