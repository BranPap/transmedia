London: Drug dealer jailed for stabbing transgender woman to death

A man charged with stabbing a transgender woman to death in her north London bedroom has been found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment at the Old Bailey.

Romy Maynard, 28, stabbed Chrissie Azzopardi multiple times at her flat in Crescent Way, Finsbury Park, north London, in April last year.

The 22-year-old, who was due to undergo gender confirmation surgery later that year, was found lying on her bed with fatal stab wounds after neighbours noticed a bad smell coming from her flat in June 2012.

Her body had been left undiscovered for more than a month.

The court heard that texts were exchanged between Ms Azzopardi and Maynard on 29 April, arranging for Maynard to come to Ms Azzopardi flat with some drugs.

The prosecution said that visit took place and ended with Maynard attacking Ms Azzopardi.

Forensic evidence placed Maynard at the flat – his fingerprint was found in the kitchen and there were partial DNA matches on the pillow and the victim’s cardigan she was wearing at the time of her death.

Crucially a full DNA profile matching Maynard was recovered from a small bloodstain on the duvet the victim was lying on.

The court heard that Maynard had attended the Whittington Hospital on Monday 30 April with a fracture to his right hand and possible bleeding. He told hospital staff he had punched someone two days before.

Maynard was arrested on Thursday 14 June. He admitted knowing Ms Azzopardi and visiting her home in the past to supply her with “weed”.

He was subsequently charged with murder.

On Friday Maynard was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment at the Old Bailey.
