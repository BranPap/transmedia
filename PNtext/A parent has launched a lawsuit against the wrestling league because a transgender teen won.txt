A parent has launched a lawsuit against the wrestling league because a transgender teen won

A wrestling league in a Texas university has had a lawsuit launched against it because a transgender teen won the competition. 

17-year-old Mack Beggs began his transition in 2015, but because of university rules he had to compete in the female championship.

The rules of the University Interscholastic League dictates that Beggs must compete as the gender listed on his birth certificate. 

He won the competition in the 110-pound category, but a group of parents have banded together to launch a lawsuit against the league.

They claim that the league is putting girls at “imminent threat of bodily harm” by allowing the teen to stay in the same weight category. 

The parents claim that he has an “unfair” advantage against the others competing, but the teens actually competing have said that they do not have a problem competing with Beggs. 

Begg’s grandmother, Nancy, called the situation “hatred” and confirmed that the wrestlers were happy to go head-to-head prior to parents becoming involved. 

“Today was about bias, hatred and ignorance. These kids have wrestled each other before, they know each other and they were not happy with this,” she said.

Mack wrote on Facebook that he was “disgusted” by the discrimination.

“The thing is, we want to wrestle each other. I feel so sick and disgusted by the discrimination not by the kids, the parents and coaches,” he wrote. “These kids don’t care who you put in front of them to wrestle. We just want to wrestle. 

“They are taking that away from me and from the people I’m competing with,” he added.
