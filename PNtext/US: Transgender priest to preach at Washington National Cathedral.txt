US: Transgender priest to preach at Washington National Cathedral

A transgender priest will make history today, becoming the first openly trans person to preach at the Washington National Cathedral.

Reverend Cameron Partridge will speak at the Cathedral during a special pride month service, presided over by Gene Robinson, who was the first openly gay Episcopal bishop in the US.

The service will include several readings and prayers from members of the LGBT community.

Partridge, a chaplain at Boston University, is one of at least seven openly trans clergy in the church.

The Episcopalian church has allowed trans clergy since 2012, when it added “gender identity and expression” to its “non-discrimination canon”.

The Cathedral has been home to funerals or memorials for eight presidents, but has never before had an openly trans preacher.

Dean of the Cathedral, Reverend Gary Hall, said: “[The service] will send a symbolic message in support of greater equality for the transgender community. 

“Cameron Partridge is a priest of great intellect, pastoral presence, and possesses a deep passion for the Gospel. We are excited for him to preach at the Cathedral.”

In the UK, transgender vicar Rachel Mann was made a Minor Canon of Manchester Cathedral earlier this month.

Earlier this week, the US Presbyterian church voted in favour of allowing same-sex couples to marry.

The 221st General Assembly of the church, which represents 2 million members, the language, voted to update the language about marriage from “a manand a woman” to “two persons”.
