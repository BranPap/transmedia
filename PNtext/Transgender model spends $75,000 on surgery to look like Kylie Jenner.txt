To achieve that, she has so far had procedures on her lips, chin, nose and breasts.

Speaking about her transition, Kyleigh explained that she felt it was her destiny to become the second Kylie Jenner as her dead name was Kyle Leigh.

“Kylie Jenner has always been my ultimate goal and inspiration, I feel like I have always emulated her and like her I didn’t start out beautiful.

“I built myself beautiful,” she told the Sun.

Potts, from Denver, Colorado, explained that people often call her Kylie Jenner.

“It was always a joke among my friends and I to refer to myself as King Kyleigh, I even have it tattooed on my bicep.”

She added that her transition was helped by looking at Kylie as she grew up.

“When I saw Kylie come into herself and transform from the ugly duckling to the b*tch everybody wants to be, I resonated with that.

“I always thought I was unattractive, ugly and never enough through the trauma of being bullied that I found confidence through altering myself.”

Potts plans to keep spending money on surgeries for her appearance.

Just some of her upcoming procedures include voice feminisation, buttock augmentation, pin and reshaping ears, a bullhorn lip lift, a blepharoplasty which will open up her eyes and a change to her hairline.

Potts explained that the one surgery she will never seek out is a vaginoplasty because she wants to keep her current genitalia.

She explained that she does not want to be “put into a box” with her gender.
