The next Olympics are going to have transgender friendly toilets

The next Olympic Games have made an important announcement for trans people.

The Tokyo 2020 Games are to introduce the most trans friendly toilet policy ever seen.

The Tokyo metropolitan government has agreed to install thousands of ‘universal-use’ toilets in venues it is building for the 2020 Olympic and Paralympics.

The city currently has a form of gender neutral toilet called a ‘daredemo toire’, which can also fit wheelchairs.

However the ‘daredemo toire’ are too large to fit enough in for the Olympics, with Tokyo being short on space for the sporting event. 

They have now agreed to build thousands of smaller versions, which will not fit wheelchairs, but are suitable for all genders and some disabilities. 

The move has been widely welcomed, and it’s hoped it will set a new precedent for sporting events.

Maki Muraki, the head of LGBTI organization Nijiiro Diversity, said: “Along with the effort to increase the number of public toilets, to raise people’s awareness that those who do not look like a typical man or woman can use a toilet as a matter of course is also important.”

It comes in stark contrast to the US, where President Trump last week reversed Obama’s trans friendly bathrooms policy. 

The POTUS has been widely condemned for the move.

Reality star Caitlyn Jenner spoke out against it, saying the president should “call me” after he promised to protect LGBT Americans before the election.
