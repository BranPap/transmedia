US elections: Record-breaking number of LGBTQ+ politicians running in midterms

There are more out LGBTQ+ politicians running in US elections than ever before.

Across 2022, a total of 1065 LGBTQ+ candidates ran or are running for office, the highest number in history. A record-breaking 63.7 per cent of known LGBTQ+ candidates won their primaries.

Among LGBTQ+ candidates, there was historic representation of marginalised communities – 38.2 per cent were people of colour; and trans, non-binary and gender non-conforming people made up 13.9 per cent.

This year, LGBTQ+ candidates ran in every one of the 50 states, and in Washington DC, the first time this has happened.

While the Democrats have the presidency, control the House and have the deciding vote in a divided Senate, Republicans in state legislatures have been pushing legislation to roll back trans rights, ban gender-affirming healthcare and ban LGBTQ+ topics from classrooms.

Polls predict that the Republicans could take control of the House, while the Senate is too close to call.

But if the GOP takes both houses, it could begin pushing its anti-LGBTQ+ agenda on a federal level.

Ridings urged LGBTQ+ voters to make their voices heard, saying: “The rise of fascism and white supremacy represents an extinction-level threat to our decades-long struggle for basic civil and education rights across the country.

It’s more important now than ever before to register and to vote.”

Ridings added: “The consequences of LGBTQ+ and allied communities not making their voices heard is an elimination of basic civil and education rights, and a fearful future and something that we’ve not known before.

“Instead, show up. We make our voices heard, and we keep moving towards our vision – a positive school transformation where LGBTQ+ youth can, at a minimum, be safe and ultimately thrive and reach their full potential.”
