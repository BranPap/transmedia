Transgender Day of Remembrance art to ‘inspire life, not just remember the dead’

Transgender Day of Remembrance came into being to remember the large number of trans people who are unlawfully killed around the world.

Many of those killed are trans people of colour, who suffer disproportionate levels of violence and poverty.

But the ‘Transgender Day of Resilience’ art project by Strong Families has brought together trans people of colour and campaign groups to create works of art that “recognizes and supports trans women and femmes of color in their lives and leadership, not just in death.”

Here is what they have created.
