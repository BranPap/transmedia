Jackie Evancho’s transgender sister won’t attend Trump inauguration performance

Trump inauguration singer Jackie Evancho has defended her decision to perform for an administration that may roll back her sister’s rights.

16-year-old America’s Got Talent singer Evancho is one of the only stars confirmed to be performing at the Trump inauguration, which is set to take place next week, on January 20.

The singer’s decision to perform has baffled many, as she has a transgender sister, Juliet Evancho – whose rights are expected to be harmed under Trump administration plans.

Incoming VP Mike Pence has already confirmed he wants to roll back the Obama administration’s transgender non-discrimination policies, insisting the issue should be settled “at the local level”.

Speaking to the New York Times, Jackie Evancho confirmed that Juliet – who is embroiled in a legal battle with her school over her right to use the female bathroom – will not be attending the inauguration.

Juliet is apparently unable to attend due to “prior engagements”.

Jackie told the outlet she could “100 percent” support her sister’s fight for legal rights and sing for Trump at the same time.

She said:  “For me it’s not political It’s just accepting people for who they are

“I just kind of thought that this [performance] is for my country, so if people are going to hate on me it’s for the wrong reason.”

The girls’ dad Mike Evancho said:”We’re fighting this discrimination at the high school… it doesn’t matter who’s going into office, we would still fight that fight.”

Juliet added that she is not politically motivated, continuing: “I’m getting out and advocating… It’s not really for any superpolitical aspect when it comes to the presidency.”

Of not attending her sister’s inauguration performance, Juliet said: “I definitely will be there in spirit,”
