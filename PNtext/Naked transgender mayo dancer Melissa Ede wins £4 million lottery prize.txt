Naked transgender mayo dancer Melissa Ede wins £4 million lottery prize

A transgender online star has won £4 million from the National Lottery.

Melissa Ede, a 57-year-old taxi driver who has thousands of followers on YouTube and Twitter, said it was “just unbelievable.

“This is something that only ever happens to other people.”

Ede, from Hull, has appeared on Judge Rinder and went on Jeremy Kyle’s show in an effort to raise £15,000 for new teeth.

During one Jeremy Kyle appearance, a couple who claimed they were “too fat to work” was thrown off the show after they transphobically abused her.

Kyle lost his temper with Stephen and Michelle Beers after they repeatedly insulted Ede, who was defending herself from the false claim that Stephen had cheated with her.

The newly minted multi-millionaire has also attracted attention for her “body confidence” YouTube videos, in which she dances, almost naked, with ketchup, milk and mayonnaise bottles attached to her breasts.

She said that the £10 scratchcard “just caught my eye” at a petrol station on her way to work, and she bought it with the change from her purchase.

Ede said she ran back into the garage after she found out about the win, shouting: “You’ve just given me £4 million – 2018 is going to be the best year ever!”



The online star, one of 200,000 to apply for a mooted one-way space mission to Mars, said she will use the money to fund a new Audi car and house.

She was also looking forward to funding her “dream wedding” to her fiancée.

Ede, a self-professed trans activist, also wanted to help others who, like her, have struggled with their gender.

“The transgender fight to where I am now has been a very difficult path,” she said.

“I received my operation almost seven years ago, and I am really proud of who I am today.

“I now want to help others in similar situations, and believe my autobiography will do just this.”
