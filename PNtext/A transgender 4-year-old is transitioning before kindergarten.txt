A transgender 4-year-old is transitioning before kindergarten

A 4-year-old trans kid is set to begin their transition in Australia.

The unnamed youngster is set to transition before they have started kindergarten, and has already started the process.



According to reports, the child has the support of the New South Wales education department.

They will be the youngest person to transition openly in Australia, and will be settled in their new gender by the time they go to to school next year.

Despite the decision having been taken by the child’s parents to respect the child’s wishes to transition, and the opinions of gender specialist medical professionals, some have suggested that the child is “too young”.

Speaking to the Mirror, Rose Cantall, clinical psychologist, said it was “absolutely too early” for the child to transition.

“I would be very hesitant and other psychologists would say the same. Everything is developmental at that age,” she told the Evening Standard .

Despite minor hestitations by some trans advocates, many have said that children who experience gender dysphoria usually know themselves.

Catherine McGregor, a trans rights activist, said: “In my experience, kids with strong cross-gender identification tend to get it right.”

Speaking to the Telegraph, clinical psychologist Michael Carr-Gregg said there is a clear difference between children who experiment with dressing up, for example, and those who experience gender dysphoria.

He said there is a “huge difference between dress-ups and a child believing with every fibre of their being they are in the wrong body.”

The mother of a 5-year-old trans girl in Texas is fighting for her daughter to have the right to be allowed to use a gender-appropriate bathroom.

Another mother with a trans 7-year-old sent a brilliant message of self-acceptance.
