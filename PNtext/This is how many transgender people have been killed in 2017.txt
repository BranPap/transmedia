This is how many transgender people have been killed in 2017

To mark Transgender Day of Remembrance, it’s important to honour victims of hatred.

The Trans Murder Monitoring Project and the Transgender Day of Remembrance organisers have compiled lists of each murder of a trans and gender non-conforming person.

Collecting information on these deaths is complicated by the fact that many trans people are misgendered in reports following their death.

There have been over 270 reported murders of trans and gender non-conforming people in the past year.

There has been a total of 2,609 reported cases in 71 countries worldwide since Transgender Day of Remembrance began in January 2008.

The names on this list are only of cases that have been reported and have attracted local media attention. The more accurate number is likely much higher, according to the Trans Murder Monitoring Project.
