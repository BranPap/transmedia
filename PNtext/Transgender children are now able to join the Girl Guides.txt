Transgender children are now able to join the Girl Guides

Transgender children are now allowed to sign up to the Girl Guides, Brownies and Rainbows as part of a policy change that breaks a 107 year long tradition. 

Children aged 5 and up will be able to join the groups if they were assigned male at birth but ‘self-identify’ as female. 

The rule also has a knock on effect to those looking to become leaders as trans women are welcome to sign up to the job role. 

The guidelines state: “Girlguiding aims to support all girls and young women. This is understood in terms of the way a person self-identifies their gender identity – a person’s inner sense of self.”

Parents of children will not be informed about any members trans status to protect their identity. 

Chief executive of the Girl Guide Association said the move now means that the organisation can stay true to its values of inclusion. 

“Girlguiding complies with the Equality Act 2010 which makes clear organisations providing single-gender services should treat people according to their acquired gender. We welcome any young person who self-identifies as a girl or young woman.”

The new policy change has been welcomed by most, but some parents deemed it “shocking” and demanded to know if a trans person would be joining a group – despite it being unlawful.

In an article by the Mail Online that attacks gender identity, Amanda Gracey, a mother of a Girl Guide said: “It’s shocking that if there is a man who believes he is a woman leading the group, it is forbidden that parents should be informed, even on residential trips.

“You might be in a situation with girls having to deal with menstruation going to a leader with no understanding at all. Every piece of safeguarding advice says you should provide separate sleeping and changing facilities for children of opposite sexes under the age of 18.”
