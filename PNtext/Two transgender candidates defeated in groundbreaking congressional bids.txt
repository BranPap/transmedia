Two transgender candidates defeated in groundbreaking congressional bids

Two trans women have lost their bids to be the first out trans people to win a seat in Congress.

There are currently no openly transgender people in the federal legislature, and just a handful of out LGB representatives.

As the country went to the polls this week, two Democrats – coincidentally both named Misty – were both hoping to break the barrier for trans representatives for the first time.

Misty Snow had been making a bid for the Senate in Utah, while Misty Plowright was running for Colorado’s 5th congressional district.

However, in a bad night for Democrats nationally that saw Donald Trump surging, both candidates failed to overcome Republican incumbents.

In Colorado, Ms Plowright faced Republican incumbent Doug Lamborn, who has won election in the seat twice before.

He held out a lead in the race, besting Ms Plowright by 62% to 31% early in the count.

In Utah, Ms Snow was crushed by incumbent Republican Senator Mike Lee, who led by 70% to 27% with a third of the vote counted.

The candidate has always been honest about her low chances of victory.

She said: “A lot of people have told me whether I win or lose, I’m already making a difference just by running.

“There are some that claim that Utah is not ready for a candidate like me, but I strongly disagree.

“Utah is not only ready but in desperate need of a Senator exactly like me. We cannot wait for others to give us equality. We have to claim equality for ourselves.”

In a statement, she said: “I am deeply grateful for the support from people all over the United States. I want to thank my voters in Utah and my national contributors as well as my wonderful team.

“I have the best campaign staff and volunteers! It is time to start celebrating the success of this Campaign. It has been a wonderful journey. “
