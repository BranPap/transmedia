Controversial YouTuber Trisha Paytas gives birth and names baby Malibu Barbie

Trisha Paytas has given birth to her first child – who she’s named Malibu Barbie.

The controversial YouTuber announced that she had given birth days after finding herself at the centre of a bizarre social media storm.

After she announced she was “1 cm dilated” on 8 September, just hours before Queen Elizabeth II passed away, fans joked that she would give birth to reincarnation of the monarch.

They apologised to the royal family and confirmed on 10 September that they were still “very much pregnant” – but on Thursday (15 September), shared a happy update.

Paytas revealed that she and husband Moses Hacmon had welcomed a baby named Malibu Barbie.

Posting the same three photos and caption to Twitter and Instagram, she wrote: “She has arrived. Malibu Barbie Paytas-Hacmon born 09.14.22 at 8.9lbs and 21 1/2.”

The controversial internet announced that she was pregnant in February this year.

Fans were surprised as she had posted a vlog in 2016 detailing her struggles with infertility titled: “WHY I CAN’T HAVE CHILDREN”.

In her pregnancy announcement vlog she said: “I’m in disbelief in so many ways but at the same time it just feels right. All of a sudden I just feel a sense of purpose.

“I just visualized being pregnant in the year 2022 and I feel so blessed and so chosen.”

She followed her pregnancy in a series of vlogs on her YouTube Channel.

Trisha Paytas has long been a controversial figure in the LGBTQ+ community.

In 2019 she came out as a gay trans man, saying that she “one thousand per cent thinks she’s transgender” while also “a thousand per cent” identifies with the gender she was assigned at birth.

She was accused of exploiting the trans community for clicks and money – with her ‘coming out video’ making her thousands in YouTube ad revenue.

She once ‘come out’ as a trans man, before saying she “a thousand per cent” identified with the gender she was assigned at birth.

Paytas later came out as non-binary and updated their pronouns to she/they.
