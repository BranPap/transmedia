Government seeks transgender community’s feedback

The coalition government is to publish its first ‘Transgender Action Plan’ later this year and is asking trans people to help shape the document.

Ministers promised last May that they would produce an action plan specifically for trans people.

The survey asks respondents which policy areas – such as medical care, hate crime and transphobic bullying – should be prioritised and asks about their own experiences.

In a special e-bulletin to the trans community, equality minister Lynne Featherstone said the responses would help formulate “initial government commitments”.

Ms Featherstone wrote: “We as a country pride ourselves on having successfully consigned the worst examples of discrimination to the past. And for the most part that is true. The days where we would see signs saying ‘no blacks, no dogs, no Irish’ in the windows of pubs and B&Bs have thankfully disappeared. 

“But I believe for transgender people we have not been so successful. For far too long too many of you had to put up with the most despicable forms of hatred and bigotry which blight not only your lives, but undermine the principles upon which this country prides itself. 

“I, along with my colleagues in the coalition government, are absolutely committed to putting a stop to this, ensuring trans people are afforded the same opportunities, freedoms and rights as any other citizen.”
