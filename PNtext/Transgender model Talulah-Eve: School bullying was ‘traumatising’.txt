Transgender model Talulah-Eve: School bullying was ‘traumatising’



Before coming out as transgender, school bullies often called her gay, leading to her using a label that wasn’t truly her.

I’d say to my bullies right now if I had them in front of me: Look at me now.

Recognising that school will not last forever and you will rise above them is key, she added.

“But the thing to remember is: We are normal women and we can do what other normal women do.”
