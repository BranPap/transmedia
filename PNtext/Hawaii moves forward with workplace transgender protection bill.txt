Hawaii moves forward with workplace transgender protection bill

A bill to protect trans people from discrimination at work is moving forward in Hawaii.

It has already been passed in the House and was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday.

Trans people are already protected from discrimination in housing, public accommodation and employment but the provision for employment has been established by rulings of the Civil Rights Commission and is not on the state statute.

Trans advocates in Hawaii argue that the bill is necessary because employers are confused by the omission.

In February, the stateâ€™s governor Neil Abercrombie signed a civil unions bill into law.
