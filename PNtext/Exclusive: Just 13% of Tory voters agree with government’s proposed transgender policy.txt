Exclusive: Just 13% of Tory voters agree with government’s proposed transgender policy

Just 13 percent of Conservative voters agree with the government’s proposed reforms to the Gender Recognition Act, according to a new poll.

The new poll by YouGov for PinkNews has found there is significant public opposition to the government’s proposed review of how transgender people can legally change their gender.

The research by YouGov for PinkNews also revealed that only 18 percent of all voters agree with government plans to let transgender people change their legal gender without a doctor’s approval.

The government has said it wants to de-medicalise the process to legally change genders, moving towards self-identification, which is used in other countries like the Republic of Ireland.

At present, transgender people have to get confirmation from a doctor specialising in gender dysphoria in order to receive a Gender Recognition Certificate, which legally recognises their gender identity.

Benjamin Cohen, chief executive of PinkNews, said: “Despite the relatively low levels of support for the proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act, this should not discourage the government from acting.

“Being a leader means being in front of your people and that it is why it is right that the prime minister has already given her clear support for de-medicalising the gender recognition process.

“It is just a shame that nearly a year has elapsed between the prime minister pledging her support for trans rights at the PinkNews Awards and now opening the long-awaited consultation.

“The lengthy delay has created a vacuum during which a misinformation campaign has been mounted by opponents to transgender rights.”



The same survey for PinkNews also found that 55 percent of people support gay couples having children through surrogacy, adoption or artificial insemination.
