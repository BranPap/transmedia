Kesha and George Takei team up for transgender equality

Kesha and George Takei have teamed up with GLAAD to make a t-shirt supporting transgender troops.

It comes after Donald Trump’s announcement last week that the US military “cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail”.

The t-shirt reads “They Make U.S. Stronger,” with the transgender flag and is being sold on the website Omaze.

The shirt raises money towards GLAAD’s fight for LGBT equality

It calls for “justice, inclusion and acceptance for the brave heroes fighting every day for our freedom”.

Takei tweeted a picture of himself wearing the shirt with the caption, “This is not okay. We must stand on the right side of history.

“Let’s come together in support of the brave and honorable individuals serving in the military — ALL of them.”

He also wrote on the Omaze website: “These courageous Americans not only make the U.S. stronger, they make all of US stronger.”



Kesha posted an Instagram of herself with the shirt, calling on her fans, who she calls “Animals”, to support the cause.

“Animals!!! I’m so excited to share that George Takei and I have teamed up with GLAAD to spread the love and support transgender people in the military,” she said.

“We’re all human, so let’s stand up for each other.”

A number of transgender soldiers and veterans have lashed out at Trump, including the woman who invented the transgender flag.

A transgender airman said “I would like to see them try to kick me out of the military”.

And the first out transgender soldier said he was “coming for war-dodger Trump”.
