World’s only transgender MP to give Kaleidoscope Trust lecture

Poland’s Anna Grodzka, the world’s only transgender parliamentarian, is to give the annual Kaleidoscope Trust lecture to mark International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.

Grodzka, who was first elected in 2011, will describe her personal struggle and achievements, and place them in the context of the issues facing the transgender community around the world.

Speaking at the time of her election she said: “Poland is changing and I am the proof along with Robert Biedron, a homosexual and the head of an anti-homophobia campaign who ran for office in Gdynia (a city on Poland’s Baltic coast).”

However, despite Grodska’s success, transphobia remains a serious problem around the globe. According to the Trans Murder Monitoring Project there were a total of 1,123 reported killings of trans people in 57 countries from January 2008 to December 2012.

And the figures show a significant increase in reported killings of trans people over the last five years. Kaleidoscope Director Lance Price said: “Issues of discrimination and violence against transgender people are often sidelined or not taken as seriously as it should be.

“Hearing from a trans woman who has achieved what in many countries remains unimaginable, is an excellent way of reminding ourselves what is possible, but also how much there still is to do.”

The lecture is taking place on Friday 17 May at the Commonwealth Club on Northumberland Avenue, Charing Cross, central London.

Entrance to the lecture is free, but places are strictly limited. To reserve a place email: [email protected]
