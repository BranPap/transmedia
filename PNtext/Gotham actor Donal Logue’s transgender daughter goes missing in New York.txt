Gotham actor Donal Logue’s transgender daughter goes missing in New York

Gotham star Donal Logue’s 16-year-old transgender daughter has been reported missing in New York.

Logue posted a tweet on Tuesday saying that his child Jade did not come home the night before when she went out to meet a friend.

“Missing – yesterday at 2PM Barclays Center/Fort Greene Brooklyn: my child, Jade Logue. 6’2″ 180 lime green hoodie dark green military parka,” Logue’s tweet said.

Logue deleted the tweet shortly after.

Jade’s mother and Logue’s ex-wife Kasey Walker has since spoken to the New York Daily News about her daughter’s disappearance.

“We obviously hope she’s OK. We hope she’s safe, and we’re making every attempt and effort,” she said.

“I can’t say anything more right now, just that we pray she’s OK and safe.”

When contacted for comment by the newspaper, Logue himself added: “Sorry. I can’t talk. I’m talking with the police right now.”

A number of actors have also spread the word on Twitter about Jade’s disappearance.

Olivia Wilde and Mark Ruffalo are among those who have called for help in finding Jade, but have since also deleted their posts.

Logue later tweeted thanking people for their “love and “support” but deleted the tweet shortly after.

“Kasey & I dearly miss our baby Jade, aka Arlo, any tips appreciated to the number below,” he had said.

A New York Police Department spokesperson confirmed that a missing person’s report had been filed, confirming that Jade had gone missing at 3pm on Monday, June 6.

Logue reached out again today for help in the early hours of the morning.

Anyone with information is urged to call (800) 577-TIPS – and is allowed to remain anonymous.
