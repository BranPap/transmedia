German Playboy to feature transgender cover star for the first time

Giuliana Farfalla is set to make history as the first transgender model on the cover of playboy.

Farfalla, who first made waves on Heidi Klum’s Germany’s Next Topmodel, will star on the next edition of the magazine.

In an excited post, the model shared a picture of the front cover on her Instagram page.

“My dears, I’m on the latest Playboy cover and very proud of the result. I hope you like the cover as much as I do.
#playboy #playboycover2018,” wrote Farfalla.

In Germany, models on the cover of Playboy pose topless.

During her experience on the show, the model said that she hoped her appearance would encourage other transgender models to come forward.

Editor-in-chief of the publication Florian Boitin said that this was in line with Heffner’s tradition of being “resolutely opposed to all forms of exclusion and intolerance.”

In featuring Farfalla, Boitin said the model is a “wonderful example of how important the fight for the right to self-determination is.”

French model Ines Rau made history last year by becoming Playboy’s first transgender Playmate.

US Playboy also featured a trans Playmate of the Month last year.

The issue is due on newsstands Thursday.
