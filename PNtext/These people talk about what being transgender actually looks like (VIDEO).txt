These people talk about what being transgender actually looks like (VIDEO)

Six young transgender people have created a video that aims to explain what being transgender looks like.

The video was produced by FTM magazine and was directed and edited by filmmakers Jake Graf and Lewis Hancox.



Graf told the Daily Mail that he was inspired to make the video after seeing similar videos take a ‘heavy tone’ and wanted to show the lighter side of being transgender.

“I wanted to get something out there that hopefully gave more of a varied and diverse perspective, and so reached out to all the people involved, and put the idea to them” Graf said.

The young trans men and women in the video talk openly about their experience navigating public toilets, their reactions to hormone replacement therapy and how they have become more optimistic about their future’s since transitioning.



Back in July Graf also released ‘Brace’, a film that examined LGBT night-life in London, with a strong focus on trans men and trans masculine people.

Speaking to PinkNews he said “I have messages daily from people who have watched Brace, and had never seen anything like it, particularly with it’s strong trans masculine theme.

“There is still a massive dearth of trans male content, and we made sure that the production values were as high as we could possibly afford on our meagre budget!”

The video also features Lewis Hancox who has released several videos covering issues faced by trans men, including the different reactions he had when he came out as transgender and the questions he has been asked about ‘trans guy sex’.
