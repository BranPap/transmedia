US: Transgender woman shot dead in LA ‘while knocking on door for help’

A transgender woman has been shot and killed in Los Angeles, while pounding on the door of a house seeking help.

Deshawnda Bradley, 21, was murdered at around 4am on Wednesday morning, in the Wilton Place area of LA.

Police confirmed they are investigating the possibility the murder was a hate crime – but no arrests have so far been made.

Detective Christopher Barling of the LAPD said she had been trying to get help at the time of her death.

However, the owner of the house did not answer – and she was shot by the assailant.

He told KTLA: “She was definitely at that door, pounding on that door seeking help.

“Deshawnda is a transgender female. At this point, we cannot say it’s a hate crime but we have not ruled out that as being a possibility.”

Her twin sister Deshawn Bradley said: “She was a loving caring person.

“She didn’t bother nobody and didn’t start drama. I don’t know why anybody would want to hurt her.

“It’s never going to be the same … my whole heart is missing.”

A vigil was held in her honour last night.

A tribute said: “Deshawnda Sanchez was a beautiful individual who was brutally murdered in South Los Angeles.

“We are showing our love and support to Deshawnda to show people that Deshawnda was loved and was a valued member of our community.

Please come and show your love to Deshawnda.”
