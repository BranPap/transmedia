London Transgender Film Festival announced

2008 London Transgender Film Festival will take place at Ritzy Picturehouse, 7th-9th November.

Organisers describe the festival as ‘Independent, experimental, cutting edge and diverse.’

They hope to ‘increase trans visibility and acknowledgement, question the gender binary, to dispel ignorance and demystify stereotypes, unite and support a diverse LGBTQI community and celebrate trans spaces and their friends.’

The films featured are to represent and focus on intersex, androgyny, gender variance, trans feminists, gender queer, and gender fluid persons of all natures, all races and cultures, ages and abilities.

As well as film screenings, the festival will include an exhibition, workshops, and a panel with special guests.

The organisers of the festival are currently accepting submissions from film makers of feature length and short films, animations and experimental films to be considered for screening at the festival.

The deadline for submissions is 20th September.

Prior to the festival, a fundraiser will be held at Gasworks, Vauxhall, on Sunday 24th August at 3pm.

Entry to the fundraiser is priced at £5.

The fundraiser will feature a screening of ‘Travel Queeries’. This documentary about the contemporary European LGBT scene covers the stories of different communities, identities and activist events.

After the screening, associate producer of ‘Travel Queeries’ Sid Peterson will be available for questions and suggestions on developing the film, which will premier in 2009.

There will also be screenings of film shorts, an exhibition, and refreshments at the fundraiser.
