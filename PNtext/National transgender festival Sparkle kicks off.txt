National transgender festival Sparkle kicks off

The national transgender festival, Sparkle, has begun in Manchester.

The festival, now in its seventh year, is the biggest event on the trans calendar and is billed as a “celebration of gender diversity”.

Tonight’s schedule includes a launch party at AXM, a banquet meal and a comedy evening.

The main event, to be held in Sackville Gardens tomorrow, will be ‘Sparkle in the Park’, with stalls and performances.

Equalities minister Lynne Featherstone will open the event with a speech at 1pm.

On Sunday, visitors can enjoy a lunch, church service, closing meal and a workshop on the government’s Transgender Action Plan.
