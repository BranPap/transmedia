Transgender antiques expert to appear in Celebrity Big Brother, as The Sun misgenders the star

Transgender star and child prodigy Lauren Harries is set to return to Celebrity Big Brother.

The 38-year-old, from Wales, will be appearing in the new UK season in January.

This series won’t just be any theme, however – it’s set to pit the very best All Stars from past editions against a set of New Stars entering the famous house for the first time.

Lauren is the first contestant to confirm they’re taking part in the show, which starts in January.

A representative for the star told the Mail Online: “All she can say is that she shall be meeting some interesting people at Elstree on the 2nd of January.”

Elstree is the location of the Big Brother studios.

Lauren recently shared a snap of herself with fellow former Celebrity Big Brother winner Rylan Clark – showing off her knew dark curls.



In reporting the news, The Sun labelled Lauren as “he” throughout sections of their report.

Despite media guidance that trans people should be referred to by the gender they identify as now – i.e. she in this case – The Sun fluctuated between two gender identities.



The star is also banned from appearing on This Morning, after giving a bizarre show several years ago.

The new series of Celebrity Big Brother is set to air in January 2017.
