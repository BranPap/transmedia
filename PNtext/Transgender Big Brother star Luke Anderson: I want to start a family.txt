Transgender Big Brother star Luke Anderson: I want to start a family

Big Brother 2012 winner Luke Anderson says he hopes to start a family in the new year.

The 31-year-old became the highest ranking transgender person on the Independent on Sunday’s Pink List in 2012 – reaching the tenth spot in November.

In an interview with Closer magazine, Luke and his wife Becki said:

“We can’t wait to have a New Year baby. We’ll pick a sperm donor who has features like Luke so the baby looks like both of us.”

After putting his £50,000 Big Brother winnings towards saving for a family home, Luke said: “It’ll give us the family we dream of.

“I think I’ll make a great dad and I know Becki will be a brilliant mum.”

Speaking about their intimate private life, Becki said:

“It might sound hard to believe, but I don’t care he hasn’t got a penis.

“We have an amazing sex life. We try all different toys and positions, though Luke doesn’t wear a strap-on.”
