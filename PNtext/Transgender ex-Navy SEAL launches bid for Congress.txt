Transgender ex-Navy SEAL launches bid for Congress

A transgender former Navy SEAL is planning to challenge one of the most senior Democrats in the House of Representatives.

Kristin Beck – who came to prominence in 2013 after she opened up about her gender transition – plans to challenge Democrat Steny Hoyer in the party’s Maryland primaries.

Mr Hoyer has represented Maryland’s 5th district since 1981, and currently serves as the House Minority Whip under Nancy Pelosi.

If he is defeated in the primary, it would mark a major shake-up for the Democrats.

Ms Beck told Huffington Post: “For the last two or three years I have been watching Congress very closely, and the reality is that the whole process has broken down and our representatives have simply dug in their heels.

“I like Steny. He’s been here for over 30 years. He’s done a really good job, I just think it’s time. You need to pass the baton onto younger generations.

“[As] Mitch McConnell put it, too many of our Representatives and Senators have ‘Sharp Elbows and Big Egos’.

“If you have been in the military, you know you have to grown up. You are past the sharp elbows and big egos stage of life.

“Let’s try to remember that we are hired once every two years by the voters to SERVE THEM in a temp job. If we fail to serve them well, then we should be replaced.”
