US televangelist compares trans people to his castrated horse after admitting not knowing what transgender means

A US televangelist has admitted in an interview that he didn’t understand what the word transgender means, compared trans people to his castrated horse, and called LGBT “insane”, compared to “normal”, straight people.

Pat Robertson, the host of the 700 Club, and the founder of the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), made the comments this week in an interview, a video of which was posted on Right Wing Watch.

After having the host explain what transgender means, Robertson says: “Why are we exposed to this stuff? They are driving the agenda, driving everybody crazy, all this sexual identity, sexual politics, ‘Mommy Has Two Mommies’ [sic] and all that stuff, it’s a tiny fringe but they seem to have control of the levers of power in the media and especially in Hollywood. But it’s insane. I just cannot believe that the normal people in America, the people who want to just live their lives can’t be allowed to do it without having this stuff imposed on them constantly. You’ve explained to me, I’m not sure we know yet.”

Later in the broadcast, he compared transgender people to his castrated horse. He said: “I have a former stallion which is now a gelding, because stallions get very aggressive. He wasn’t trying to be a girl, we just made him into a less aggressive male. I want you to see him, he’s big and beautiful.”

Robertson of the 700 Club, recently claimed that gay men have been purposely spreading HIV using special rings which cut the hand of strangers they shake hands with.

Openly gay television host Anderson Cooper, since used a segment of his show to criticise Robertson for the story.

Robertson in July spoke against equal marriage during his programme, joking that Facebook should install a “vomit” button to represent his reaction to pictures of gay people kissing.
