Terrence Higgins Trust launches new transgender online resource

HIV and sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust has launched two new support guides for the UK’s transgender community.

While research into trans health remains patchy, there is a growing consensus that transgender people are at a dramatically increased risk of HIV and poor sexual health.

At this year’s International AIDS Conference in Washington, delegates heard that as many as 68% of trans women (those labelled male at birth but who identify as female) in the US may be living with HIV.

In Europe, estimates of HIV prevalence among trans women range from 11.5% to 57%.

In contrast, HIV prevalence among the UK’s general population is 0.15%, rising to 5% among gay and bisexual men.

Michelle Ross, Trans Awareness Facilitator at Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “It’s becoming increasingly clear that trans people today face a range of issues that place them at increased risk of infection.

“We know, for example, that many trans people have ongoing problems around body image and self esteem, which can lead them to take serious risks with their health.

Ms Ross added: “We are hugely proud of these new resources, and hope they will give more trans people – both here in the UK and further afield – the support and confidence they need to take control of their sexual health and live happier, healthier lives.”
