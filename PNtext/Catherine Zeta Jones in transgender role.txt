Catherine Zeta Jones in transgender role

Catherine Zeta Jones is rumoured to be the next high profile star to become trans gendered following the critically acclaimed film, Transamerica.

Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman, who won a Golden Globe for Transamerica, has shown that being a woman playing a man who self defines as a woman can get you noticed.

According to the New York Post, Catherine Zeta Jones is being lined up to play a 1960s sex-change cabaret artist in an upcoming movie.

The biopic of real-life aristocratic transsexual April Ashley will look at how her marriage to Baron Rowallan was annulled in a landmark court case.

Hubby Michael Douglas, meanwhile, once joked that he thought Catherine was a “man in drag” when they first met because they didn’t kiss until they’d been dating for nine months
