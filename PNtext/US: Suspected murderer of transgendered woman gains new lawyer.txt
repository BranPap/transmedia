US: Suspected murderer of transgendered woman gains new lawyer

In Washington DC, a 55-year-old man accused of stabbing a trans woman in the face back in February has been assigned a new defence lawyer.

Thomas Dybdahl, representing for Gary Niles Montgomery, said last week he would be stepping down as defence counsel and would be replaced by Anthony Matthews.

Gary Niles Montgomery, a resident from the north east part of America’s capital, faces a charge of second-degree murder while armed.

It’s alleged he murdered Deoni Jones while she was waiting at a bus stop in the city’s Benning Heights neighborhood earlier this year.

According to Metroweekly, the prosecution will continue to seek a grand jury indictment against Montgomery.

The police report said the attack happened at the junction of East Capitol Street and Sycamore Road at around 8:15 pm, Thursday, February 2.

The victim died in hospital the next morning.

Mr Montgomery was arrested eight days later following a week-long manhunt during which police posted video footage of their prime suspect on YouTube and asked the public to help identify Jones’s attacker.

Shortly after being arrested, Mr Montgomery underwent a mental observation and was judged competent to stand trial.
