Model Andreja Pejić comes out as a transgender woman

Model Andreja Pejić has revealed that she is a transgender woman.

Pejić, who began modelling in 2007, was famed for her androgynous appearance, and last year co-starred in a David Bowie music video alongside Tilda Swinton.

She had previously modelled both men’s and women’s clothes, but has announced today that she has transitioned, changed her name to Andreja, and will only model as female from now on.

She told People: “I want to share my story with the world because I think I have a social responsibility.

“I hope that by being open about this, it becomes less of an issue.

“I always dreamt of being a girl. One of my earliest memories is spinning around in my mom’s skirt trying to look like a ballerina.

“I kept my dreams and my imagination to myself and became pretty good at acting as a boy. But I was hiding who I was.”

Though she said she had undergone reassignment surgery, she added: “I completely agree with Laverne Cox and Janet Mock… what’s in between anyone’s legs is not who they are.”

She told her Facebook fans: “I think we all evolve as we get older and that’s normal but I like to think that my recent transition hasn’t made me into a different individual.

“Same person, no difference at all just a different sex  I hope you can all understand that.

“As a transgender woman I hope to show that after transition (a life-saving process) one can be happy and successful in their new chapter without having to alienate their past.

“Most importantly differences should not equal divisions, let’s all stand together in union.”
