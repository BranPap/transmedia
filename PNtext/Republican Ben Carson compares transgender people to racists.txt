Republican Ben Carson compares transgender people to racists

Failed Presidential candidate Dr Ben Carson has compared transgender people to racists, saying they “don’t make sense”.

The former neurosurgeon, Fox News pundit and failed Republican Presidential wannabe made the bizarre comments in an interview with The Hill.

In the interview, he compared trans people to people who put on a fake accent and pretend to be from Afghanistan.

He said: “For someone to wake up and think that they belong to a different sex because they feel different that day is the same as if you woke up and said, ‘I’m Afghani today because I saw a movie about that last night, and even though my genetics might not indicate that, that’s the way I feel, and if you say that I’m not, then you’re a racist’.

“It’s the same kind of situation.

“What we ought to do is utilize our brains, utilize our common sense as human beings. We’ve known what men are and what women are for thousands of years. So we don’t know anything, everything is relative — this doesn’t make any sense.”

“It’s not based on your feelings, it’s based on what you are.

“Can a leopard change its spots? No. It can’t because it feels like maybe it’s a different creature. No. it’s still a leopard. Sorry.”

The Republican previously insisted that same-sex marriage is a Marxist plot from the New World Order, claiming in a speech to a listed anti-gay group that gay weddings are part of a plan “to destroy unity [and] bring America down.”

Carson has repeatedly been forced to apologise when caught making overtly homophobic comments – apologising after he was caught comparing gay people to paedophiles, and again apologising after he was caught claiming that prisons ‘prove’ being gay is a choice.

His repeated humiliations have not dissuaded him, however – last October he compared gay couples to conjoined twins.
