UK: Transgender charity secures lottery funding

One of the UK’s few trans-focussed charities, Gender Intelligence, has secured a £10,000 lottery grant.

The Camden-based group was one of over 200 projects to receive funding from the Big Lottery Fund’s Awards for All scheme.

The money will be used to provide a series of workshops for young transgender people, which will provide them with support in their transition, as well as tackling prejudice.

The charity’s founder, Jay Stewart, said: “It’s been a long slog but it’s worth it.

“We have lots of young people attending our sessions but we know there must be more out there, sitting alone in their bedrooms, not knowing where to turn. 

“We can offer them knowledge and advice and now the new workshops should help us reach out to them.”

“At the moment there isn’t a lot out there to help young people who have questions or are confused about their gender. 

“We’ve even had people travel overnight from Scotland to attend our sessions. 

“This Awards for All funding will make a huge difference to us and help us to explore the idea that knowledge of transgender issues is crucial to the wellbeing of the young people affected and, importantly, their families.”

The special workshops, titled ‘Knowledge is Power’, will start next month.
