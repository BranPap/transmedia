Watch: Transgender 13-year-old makes heartfelt plea for acceptance

A transgender YouTube star has posted a video urging for people to accept everyone for who they are.

The 13-year-old Jazz, who was thrust into the media  spotlight when she appeared on TV programme 20/20 aged just 6, says: “A lot of transgender people are treated unfairly. It’s upsetting to know there are still prejudiced people who don’t accept others.

She talks about the prejudice she has experienced, saying: “When some people say we don’t appreciate God’s creation, or argue that the Bible doesn’t say LGBTQ people are ethical, I get confused.

“It befuddles me how we have to undermine others and look forward to their failures.

“It’s annoying when people argue about being different. To place it into right and wrong is beyond what it is – in being different, there is no right or wrong, it’s just who you are.

“Being transgender has made me who I am: a stronger person, a more confident person, and a person with pride.

“Progress is being made, and the world is transitioning into a new time. I can see the change.

Jazz, who keeps her surname and where in the US she lives a secret for her safety reasons, also posted a video of her answering questions from the public.

Her high profile in the media came about after many TV appearances, including a documentary about her on the Oprah Winfrey Network.

Jazz has also founded the Transkids Purple Rainbow Foundation, and has co-written a book, I Am Jazz.
