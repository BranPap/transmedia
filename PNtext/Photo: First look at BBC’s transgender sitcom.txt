The BBC has revealed details about a new transgender-focussed sitcom, Boy Meets Girl.


The show was first commissioned in August last year, following a talent search aiming to develop a show focussed on the trans community.

The six-part sitcom, which will air on BBC2 later this year, stars Harry Hepple and trans actress Rebecca Root.

The show – which has been likened to Gavin and Stacey revolves around the developing relationship between the pair’s characters Leo, 26, and Judy, 40.

The series was created by Trans Comedy Award winner Elliott Kerrigan along with Simon Carlyle and Andrew Mettam.

The show also stars Denise Welch of Waterloo Road as Leo’s mother, Janine Duvitski of Benidorm, Nigel Betts of Emmerdale, Lizzie Roper of Hollyoaks and Jonny Dixon of Coronation Street.

BBC Commissioning Editor Kristian Smith said: “Boy Meets Girl is a heart-warming romantic comedy that draws on the glorious differences that shape all of us.

“It’s a brilliant thing to be able to support comedy that is not only funny, but can also promote affirming messages of humanity and acceptance.”

The show is the first major role for Root, who usually works as a specialist voice coach heping trans people with their speaking voice.

Other trans-focussed shows, such as Amazon’s Transparent, have received criticism for casting cisgender actors in trans roles.

A broadcast date is yet to be confirmed.
