PinkNews Exclusive
A transgender man is appealing for help after he was abused by two mothers on a London train.

Naith Payton, 28, claims he was called a “faggot” and a “boy with tits” by the women while travelling on the London Overground train.

According to video footage, the women yelled a string of foul-mouthed insults at the chef, all while their two young children sat watching.

They then ordered their own children to insult the passenger – telling their kids to “shout at him and tell him he’s bad”, according to the victim’s account.



Mr Payton took to Facebook the following day to share a video of the ordeal, after dealing with the initial shock.

The incident, which took place between Willesden Junction and Kensington Olympia in west London, ended with the women smashing the phone out of his hand.

He said: “When they got on the train, they were swearing and using slurs, and there were some children on the train, including their own.

“One of them, the blonde woman, was repeatedly yelling ‘you fucking prick’ down the phone, while her daughter was sitting in her lap.

“I asked them to stop swearing, since there were kids around, and they turned on me.

“I didn’t get the worst of what they said on camera, but it was very homophobic and transphobic – they called me a ‘faggot’, a ‘fucking gay boy’ and a ‘boy with tits’.

“They also consistently misgendered me, as you can hear in the video.”

Mr Payton told PinkNews: “Nothing like this has happened to me before, and it was very upsetting to be made to feel unsafe so close to where I live.

“It was also a reminder that homophobia and transphobia are still a real problem.”

The incident has now been reported to police who are understood to be investigating.
