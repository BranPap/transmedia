Hollyoaks character Blessing to come out as transgender

A main character in Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks will soon come out as transgender.

Character Blessing will come out to Tony as a trans woman in an episode next month.

Blessing will also reveal that she spent time in a young offenders’ institute before running away to Hollyoaks.

She will be pushed to reveal her past when her family hires a private investigator to track her down.

Modupe Adeyeye, who plays Blessing, said: “Blessing is a loud, feisty, glamorous girl and I hope her story will prove inspiring to viewers. I think people love or hate Blessing but I hope that the people who need to be touched by her story will be.”

Hollyoaks worked with the Gender Trust and All About Trans to develop the character.

The storyline will air from 16 May.
