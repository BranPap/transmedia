YouTuber and playwright Abigail Thorn explains why Shakespeare has ‘so much trans potential’

In the playwright’s words, it’s a story about “sword fighting, lesbianism, denial, disappointed parents, and a magical doorway”.

The backlash to I, Joan influenced the staging of The Prince, especially when it came to safety

“I was very, very glad that the producers and I had had a conversation right at the start about security. I knew there was a potential for this subject matter to prove controversial,” Abigail says.

The Prince is running from 15 September to 8 October at Southwark Playhouse. Tickets are available here.
