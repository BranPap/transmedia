Sainsbury’s apologises for transgender toilet ban

Sainsbury’s has apologised after a transgender woman was told by a Surrey store that she could not use the women’s toilets.

Stephanie Collins, 55, told the Surrey Herald that she used the women’s toilets on a recent visit but as she came out, a staff member stopped her and told her she should use the disabled facilities instead.

Ms Collins, who said she was “embarrassed” by the incident, said the supermarket should ensure staff are more tactful.

In a statement given to trans rights campaigner Jane Fae, a Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We would like to apologise unreservedly for any offence caused. We pride ourselves on our high standards of customer service, something that clearly has not been met here.”

“Our store manager will be writing to Miss Collins to apologise in person. We hope that this will not prevent her from shopping with us in future.”
