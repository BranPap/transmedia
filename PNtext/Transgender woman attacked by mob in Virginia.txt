Transgender woman attacked by mob in Virginia

A transgender woman in Virginia was attacked by a mob outside a store last Saturday afternoon.

The assault follows the beating of a Maryland trans woman in a McDonald’s restaurant, which was filmed by a member of staff.

In Saturday’s incident, the 32-year-old victim was kicked, punched and beaten with a metal broom handle by at least four attackers.

The attack, which took place outside a 7-Eleven in Fredericksburg, began after the victim had an argument with one of the alleged attacker’s relatives about a dog.

The victim, who asked not to be named, told Washington DC’s NBC4 that the gang shouted transphobic abuse as they beat her.

“The first time I feared for my life is when I actually got knocked out,” she said.

The attack ended when the victim’s neighbour laid on top of her to protect her. Witnesses caught the number plate of a fleeing car and two youths were arrested. Police are seeking two more suspects.

The Maryland attack, on 22-year-old Chrissy Lee Polis, caused shock around the world when footage was aired on YouTube last month.

Ms Polis was seen being kicked and dragged across the floor by two females.

An 18-year-old and a 15-year-old have been indicted by a grand jury on first and second-degree assault as hate crimes.
