Transgender woman says she has been left ‘half man’ by NHS surgery refusal

A transgender woman from Burnley has accused the NHS of leaving her “half man, half woman” by refusing to pay for her breast surgery.

Cathy Ann Daniels, 57, was born physically male. She had lower (genital) sex reassignment surgery last year at a London hospital and hopes to have surgery to increase the size of her bust.

However, she has been told that the £5,000 procedure is classed as cosmetic surgery and is not routinely funded by NHS East Lancs.

Ms Daniels told the Lancashire Telegraph: “I have been left half man, half woman because my doctor will not refer me to the PCT for breast augmentation.

“I have undergone half the operation, but now I’m being kept in limbo because apparently there is no funds.

“Breasts are a really important part of being a woman and being like this is making me suicidal.”

Ms Daniels is being backed by the Gender Society. 

Michele Bridgman, from the charity, said transgender people have to face a “geographic lottery” because not all health trusts will pay for surgery.
