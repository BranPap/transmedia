Oxford University changes dress code for transgender students

Transgender students at Oxford University will be permitted to wear formal dress appropriate to their new sex.

The institution has changed its strict dress code for students taking exams or attending formal events after a campus LGBT group intervened.

The changes, which come into force this week, mean that trans women will be permitted to wear skirts and trans men will be permitted to wear suits, jackets and ties.

Jess Pumphrey, the LGBTQ Soc’s executive officer, said the change will make exam time and formal events significantly less stressful for trans students.

She told The Oxford Student newspaper: “In future there will be no need for transgender students to cross-dress to avoid being confronted by invigilators or disciplined during their exam.”

An Oxford University spokesperson said: “The regulations have been amended to remove any reference to gender, in response to concerns raised by Oxford University Student Union that the existing regulations did not serve the interests of transgender students.”
