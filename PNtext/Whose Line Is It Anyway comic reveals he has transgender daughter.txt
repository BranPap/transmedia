Whose Line Is It Anyway comic reveals he has transgender daughter

Whose Line Is It Anyway? star Colin Mochrie has revealed that he has a transgender daughter.

The 59-year-old comic is best known for his appearances on both the US and UK versions of classic improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway?.

The comic, who is married to Canadian actress Debra McGrath, quietly announced the news on Twitter.

He wrote: “My 90-yr-old mother-in-law and 87-yr-old mother love and acceptance of our trans daughter warms me. Wonder why some who are younger can’t.”

The comedian added: “The negative is that my mom refers to the community as BLT. It’s a learning curve.”


Thanking fans for their positive reaction, Mochrie posted on Facebook: “Thank you for the positive feedback on Kinley. For those less supportive, I hope somehow you can find empathy for those different than you and find a way to be more comfortable with those you don’t understand. Or you can remove your head from your ass.”

Although it is the first time the news has made a splash, Mochrie and McGrath previously spoke about their daughter’s transition at a fundraiser for Canadian LGBT group the Welcome Friend Association.

In a speech the pair addressed their daughter’s transition and learning to switch her name and pronouns.

Mochrie has appeared in more than 300 episodes of Whose Line Is It Anyway?, which ran for 10 seasons in the UK and 12-and-counting seasons in the US.
