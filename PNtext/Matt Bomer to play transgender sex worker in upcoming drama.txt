Matt Bomer to play transgender sex worker in upcoming drama

Gay actor Matt Bomer has signed on to play a transgender woman in an upcoming drama.

The Magic Mike star has signed up to lead Tim McNeil’s drama ‘Anything’, according to Variety.

Based on a play of the same name, the plot features a suicidal widower (played by John Carroll Lynch) who moves to Los Angeles and forms an unlikely friendship with a transgender sex worker (Bomer).

According to the site, the pair “must reconcile their vastly different backgrounds as they fill the void in each other’s lives”.

Mark Ruffalo is serving as an executive producer for the film.

He said: “I’m very happy to be part of this daring project. Love is at the essence of great storytelling and transcends all discrimination and politicisation.”

But the news has not gone down well with some members of the transgender community, who are angry to see Bomer following in a line of cis male actors to play transgender women.

Eddie Redmayne, Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto  and Andrew Garfield have all been criticised for taking transgender roles in the past, while trans actors and actresses struggle to find work.

Jamie Clayton, a trans actress who appears in Netflix series Sense8, was among those to pick on the trend addressing Bomer and Michelle Rodriguez, who is also playing a transgender man in an upcoming film

Clayton tweeted: “I really hope you both choose to do some actual good for the trans community one day.”
