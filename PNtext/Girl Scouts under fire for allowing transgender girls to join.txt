Girl Scouts under fire for allowing transgender girls to join

The Girl Scouts of America is under fire – for allowing trans girls to join for the first time ever.

The organisation, which welcomes both male and female adult volunteers but only allows female children to join, has received criticism for its policy on trans girls.

The policy says: “Girl Scouts is proud to be the premiere leadership organization for girls in the country. 

“Placement of transgender youth is handled on a case-by-case basis, with the welfare and best interests of the child and the members of the troop/group in question a top priority. 

“That said, if the child is recognized by the family and school/community as a girl and lives culturally as a girl, then Girl Scouts is an organization that can serve her in a setting that is both emotionally and physically safe.”

The American Family Association claimed: “Please, stop listening to the few individuals who would use young boys as pawns in the culture war and destroy this organization in the process of advancing their social agenda.

“Girls in the organization will be forced to recognize and accept transgenderism as a normal lifestyle. 

“Boys in skirts, boys in make-up and boys in tents will become a part of the program. This change will put young innocent girls at risk.

“Adults are willing to experiment on our kids – both the boys who are confused and the girls who will wonder why a boy in a dress is in the bathroom with them.”

It is unclear how exactly girls are more at risk from transgender children compared to the male adult volunteers who have been welcomed by the Girl Scouts for years.

The Girl Scouts are considered more accepting than the Boy Scouts, which has ties to the Mormon church and only lifted a ban on gay scouts in 2013. 

A ban on gay adult volunteers remain in effect, though a New York troupe have openly defied it.
