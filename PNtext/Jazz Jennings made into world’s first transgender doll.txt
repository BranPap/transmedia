Jazz Jennings made into world’s first transgender doll

Jazz Jennings first hit the headlines after opening up about being trans on YouTube two years ago.

After racking up millions of views online she also landed a reality TV series, All That Jazz, and teamed up with Clean and Clear for a new advertising campaign.

However, the 16-year-old is now set for another first, as a doll of her likeness is set to become the first transgender toy on sale.

The 18-inch doll will be unveiled in New York next week and is the handiwork of toy company Tonner Doll. It’s believed to be the first transgender doll on the market.



Tonner said they had chosen Jazz for their next doll to continue their history of representing “socially transformational heroes”.

CEO Robert Tonner added: “Jazz stands for everything I respect from a human nature point of view – she’s incredibly brave, intelligent, warm-hearted and creative.”

Jazz is an honorary co-founder of the Transkids Purple Rainbow Foundation, as well as the youngest person ever featured in The Advocate Magazine’s Forty Under 40.

As well as speaking at universities and conferences, the teen has also written a number of books about her experiences.

Opening up about dating while transgender, she also previously said it could be “social suicide” for potential partners.

“Let’s face it, your average straight cis-gender teenage boy isn’t going to pursue a relationship with a trans-girl.” she added.

“Even if he does find her attractive, it could be social suicide if he acts on his feelings. I know this because this is my life.”

However, she has previously suffered from abuse from hate groups. Right wing protesters One Million Moms attacked her for trying to “normalise the transgender lifestyle”, and a school cancelled readings of her book after pressure from Liberty Counsel.
