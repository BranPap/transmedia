Rebel Wilson jokes about practicing ‘transgender face’ to win a BAFTA

Pitch Perfect star Rebel Wilson has joked that to win a BAFTA, she has been “practicing her transgender face”.

The star, best known for her role as Fat Amy (Patricia) in the Pitch Perfect films, made the joke at the Royal Opera House in London, before presenting the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA.



Wilson joked that she needed to meet the diversity requirements to win a BAFTA, as well as poking fun at the Oscars for the controversy surrounding a lack of black nominees.

She started, pretending to be awkwardly reading her intro from a piece of paper: “I have never been invited to the Oscars. Because as you know they are racists.

“But the BAFTAs have diverse members and thats what we all want to see in life isn’t it – diverse members.”

She went on:”One day I hope to return here to win a BAFTA myself. I have already been practicing my transgender face.”

Before continuing to “Sorry, Idriss Elba you’re making me a bit nervous. I’m just sociologically programmed to want chocolate on Valentine’s Day.”
