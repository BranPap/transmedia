Big Brother US gets first out transgender contestant

The first openly transgender housemate will enter the US Big Brother house soon.

Audrey Middleton, from a small town in Georgia, will look to repeat the success of out trans Big Brother UK contestant Nadia Almada, who won the fifth season here.

Middleton, who was open about her identity on her application, calls herself a “superfan” of Big Brother, is a former competitive swimmer and MMA ring girl.

The 25-year-old digital media consultant says in her bio that she “loves to get dressed up and look fabulous head-to-toe, but also isn’t afraid to get dirty.”

She also said she likes “fabulous hair, lashes, makeup,” and is “the Beyoncé of her life story.”

According to Variety, Middleton will discuss her transition openly on the show, from the first episode of season 17.

“Audrey Middleton is a ‘Big Brother’ super fan who applied online, like many other hopeful houseguests, and was open about her transition in the application process,” a CBS spokesperson said

“It is customary for ‘Big Brother’ houseguests to share personal news inside the house, and Audrey plans to discuss her story with the houseguests in her own words during the premiere episode on Wednesday, June 24.”

In her introduction video, she says:“I think that I’m bringing in a very versatile perspective of a character that hasn’t been brought before,” Middleton said in her introduction video.

“I think there’s a chance I could be a misunderstood hero, but I’m going to be a hero.”
