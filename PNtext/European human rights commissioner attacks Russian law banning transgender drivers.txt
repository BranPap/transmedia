European human rights commissioner attacks Russian law banning transgender drivers

The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights has attacked a new Russian law which bans transgender people from obtaining driver’s licenses.

This week, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev enacted new regulations that ban people with ‘sex disorders’ from driving, as the government claims that they are more likely to crash.

The ban applies to anyone deemed to have a “gender identity disorder” – including “transsexualism” and “dual-role transvestism”.

Other “disorders of sexual preference” also merit a ban – including exhibitionism, sadomasochism and paedophilia – which could also be used to target gay men.

Nils Muižnieks – the current Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights – condemned the new law in a statement.

He said: “The new Russian rules banning people from driving because of their gender identity are ridiculous and unlawful.

“Discriminating against people on these grounds is a violation of European human rights norms and risks exacerbating an already hostile climate against LGBTI in Russia.

“I urge the Russian authorities to immediately amend the rules to remove this ban.”

Shockingly, the Russian Professional Drivers Union backed the ban.

Union boss Alexander Kotov said: “We have too many deaths on the road, and I believe toughening medical requirements for applicants is fully justified.”
