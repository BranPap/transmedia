Transgendered fire-fighter wins discrimination case

An American fire-fighter has won a discrimination claim against Knoxville Fire Service ruling that she was harassed and victimised after undergoing a sex change.

Fire Captain Jamie Faucon, filed a complaint against the Knoxville Fire Chief Carlos Perez and her supervisor, Mark Foulkes, claiming she was denied a car and overtime because she is a transgendered woman. She further claims that Mr Foulkes used the incorrect gender terminology to refer to her in conversations.

Ms Faucon underwent surgery to change from male to female in March of last year. She said that fellow fire-fighters were supportive of her plight before her operation. “I had worked the law department and Chief Ed Cureton, the former fire chief,” she said. “They were very supportive. We went through the rigours of getting them to understand the situation, the medical terms, some of the legal aspects. They were very, very supportive and I’m very appreciative for what they did.”

The fire-fighter claims that not being offered a “drive home” vehicle means that she can not respond to emergencies and this reduces her pay. “To not have a drive home vehicle, they cannot have you in a non-call status.

“There is no requirement for you to drive your own personal vehicle in an emergency situation. I, on several occasions, had been called to respond to emergency calls.”
