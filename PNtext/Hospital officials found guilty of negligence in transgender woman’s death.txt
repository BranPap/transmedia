Hospital officials found guilty of negligence in transgender woman’s death

Health officials in Pakistan have been found guilty of committing criminal negligence after a transgender activist died.

Alesha, a transgender activist in Pakistan was shot multiple times by a gang member. When admitted to The Lady Reading Hospital, doctors failed to treat her injuries straight away.



The inquiry discovered that the medical director, hospital director and professors of the surgery and orthopaedic wards are guilty of committing criminal negligence.

The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Department requested that the board of governors at Lady Reading Hospital to act upon the findings of an inquiry. Strict action has been recommended.

The committee, put together by the government, has encouraged criminal cases against the top officials to prevent a similar incident occurring again.

Alesha died of gunshot wounds after she was attacked for being transgender at the end of May. Her case was not treated as an emergency despite her severe bleeding.

The inquiry report said that Alesha could have been saved if an urgent operation was performed.

However, the patient was left in a waiting area for hours whilst doctors decided whether to place her in a female or male ward.

Alesha’s murder is one of a number of cases where trans people are being attacked. Last week, a trans woman was shot after three men broke into her home and attempted to rape her.

Protests have broken out in the region following the recent attacks on the transgender community in Pakistan.



In Pakistan transgender people were granted civil rights in 2009. However, LGBT people still struggle with equality, as being lesbian, gay or bisexual is a criminal offence that carries a sentence of up to 10 years imprisonment.

Most south Asian countries, including Pakistan, recognise the concept of a third gender where members are not referred to as either male or female.
