Gwyneth Paltrow pulls out of transgender film

Gwyneth Paltrow has pulled out of appearing in The Danish Girl, a film about trans painter Einar Wegener.

Paltrow was herself a replacement for Charlize Theron for the part of the painter’s wife Gerda.

She told Harper’s Bazaar she pulled out of the role due to a change of shooting location, which she felt would be problematic for her children.

Nicole Kidman is to play the painter before and after transition.

Wegener was one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment and had the surgery in the 1930s.

She later took the name Lili Elbe and it is thought she may have been intersex or had Klinefelter’s Syndrome. She died in 1931 of complications after her fifth surgery.

The movie’s script is based upon David Ebershoff’s novel The Danish Girl and will be directed by Tomas Alfredson.
