Transgender man shot five times leaving bar

A transgender man was shot at repeatedly when leaving a bar in Philadelphia Sunday night.

The unnamed victim, 21, is thought to have been shot at at least five times in the incident.

The victim said that after leaving the bar two men followed him two blocks down the street before withdrawing the weapon and shooting at him.

They are now recovering in a nearby hospital, where they’re thought to be in a stable decision.

“Based on ballistic evidence, we know at least five shots were fired from a small caliber, semi-automatic weapon,” Chief Inspector Scott Small told CBS Philadelphia. 

“We don’t have a motive for the shooting at this time.” 

Police are unsure if the victim was targeted due to his gender identity or for another reason and were hoping to gain additional information from nearby security cameras.

This year has been the most deadly on record for trans violence in the US.

Meanwhile a daughter discovered she is being sued by her mother recently for transitioning.

Anmarie Calgaro claimed in court that her parental rights had been infringed and as well as suing her daughter was also suing the county health board, school district, and two local health care non-profit organisations.
