Check out the trailer for Whoopi Goldberg’s transgender model TV show

The first trailer is here for a reality show featuring transgender models – masterminded by Whoopi Goldberg.

The Sister Act star is the executive producer of ‘Strut’, which will follow the day-to-day lives of a group of trans fashion models.

Focusing on Slay Model Management, the show will tell the story of the world’s first exclusively transgender modelling agency.

Ahead of the show’s debut on Oxygen next month, a trailer for the show has debuted.

Goldberg said: “Our models come from all walks of life; all different backgrounds and ethnicities.

“They are struggling with things we can all relate to — trying to make ends meet, fighting to make a name for themselves and navigating the minefields of personal relationships.

“All of these struggles are amplified by the fact that they are also fighting to break down barriers and taking on the responsibility of representing the transgender community in today’s society.

“It’s time to separate caricature from real people, and that’s what we are doing with Strut.”

As one girl puts it: “They want a girl that’s 6’2″, 35-25-25 — they don’t ask if you have a penis or not.”

The cast includes former America’s Next Top Model contestant Isis King, Instagram star Laith De La Cruz, and models Dominique Jackson, Ren Spriggs and Arisce Wanzer.

The show premieres 20 September on US cable channel Oxygen.
