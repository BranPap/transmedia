‘Girls’ creator Lena Dunham producing transgender documentary

Girls creator Lena Dunham has announced she is working on a documentary series about a suit-maker that caters to the transgender community.

The star is producing the HBO show, titled Three Suits, about New York tailor Bindle & Keep, which has earned a reputation for serving New York’s genderqueer and transgender community, due to its trans-friendly approach.

According to Vanity Fair the show will take a look at the shop’s transgender clientèle, examining “the significance of the process for a set of customers with complex gender identities”

Dunham tweeted: “So excited about this doc [Girls writer Jenni Konner] and I are producing! Bindle & Keep: breaking down binaries, making smart suits.”

The shop’s founder and owner Daniel Friedman said: “We were totally blown away when Lena’s team first reached out to us—the art we practice is so specialized that it was hard to believe heavy hitters were taking an interest.”

Last year Dunham vowed that she won’t marry boyfriend Jack Antonoff until same-sex couples can marry across the US.

She said: “I don’t want to get married until all gay people can get married.”
