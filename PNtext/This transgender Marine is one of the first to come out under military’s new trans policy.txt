This transgender Marine is one of the first to come out under military’s new trans policy

Marine Aaron Wixson has become one of the first to come out as transgender under the military’s new policy. 

Lance Corporal Wixson was able to change his name and gender in the Department of Defence database, and will soon be able to adhere to the male dress code and use men’s facilities upon completing his treatment. 



Wixson told CNN, who reported that he is the first to openly serve in the marines: “I will feel that I am finally seen as who I really am.” 

Wixson is one of over 15,000 transgender troops serving in the US Military following the Pentagon’s announcement that the ban on transgender people serving openly in the US military would be lifted. 

With the lift of the ban, transgender soldiers have been granted access to gender specific healthcare. 

Wixson hopes to get bilateral mastectomy before May, and has filed out an “exception to policy” request in order to use male facilities and wear a men’s uniform. 

The Marine said the military’s response has been encouraging. 

He told CNN: “They’ve worked very, very hard to get me the help I need and help me get through this process. I’m very lucky and grateful for their support.”

“When you get to be yourself you’re a much more effective member of the team.” 

Wixson’s commanding officer Col. Walker Field said they were “lucky to have such talent in our ranks.” 

“Every Marine in this command deserves the very best opportunity to reach his or her full potential, including Lance Cpl. Wixson. Enabling Lance Cpl. Wixson to openly serve as a transgender Marine necessarily increases readiness and broadens the overall talent of the organisation,” Field added.
