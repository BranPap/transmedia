Mindy Kaling and Laverne Cox react to Josie Totah coming out as transgender

Mindy Kaling, Laverne Cox and other stars have welcomed actress Josie Totah’s decision to come out as transgender.

The 17-year-old star, who has featured in Glee, Champions and Jessie, made the revelation in a powerful essay for Time magazine in which she said she regretted allowing herself to become known as a gay boy.

https://t.co/Ltz8ttemoB For so long I’ve been trying to hide who I was. And I did it in fear. In fear that I wouldn’t be accepted or loved. I know now more than ever I’m ready to take the step to becoming myself. I am Transgender and this is my story.

Totah introduced the essay on Twitter by writing: “For so long I’ve been trying to hide who I was. And I did it in fear. In fear that I wouldn’t be accepted or loved.

“I know now more than ever I’m ready to take the step to becoming myself. I am Transgender and this is my story.”

And stars rushed to congratulate her on taking the step of coming out publicly.

Champions creator Mindy Kaling, who starred in the fantastic Ocean’s 8 this year, praised her star, writing: “I love you, Josie.

“I’m so glad you’re able to speak your truth and live as your authentic self. You’re also so damn talented – I can’t wait to write for you again! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️”

In her essay, Totah described having profound anxiety about her gender identity, adding that she felt she was lying by allowing people to believe she was gay.

Totah also wrote that she wore girls’ clothes under her clothes, and had a crippling fear of going through male puberty.

She also spoke about her faith, and said she has “come to believe that God made me transgender.”

Going forward, she said she hoped to play female roles so she won’t have to “contort” herself to play a boy.

She added that she will “gun for those roles” because “it’s a clean slate – and a new world.”
