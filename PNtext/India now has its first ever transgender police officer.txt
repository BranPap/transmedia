India now has its first ever transgender police officer

Prithika Yashini has started her dream career as India’s first ever transgender police officer.

After an arduous battle with the courts, Yashini became the first trans person to be accepted into an Indian police force when she joined Tamil Nadu’s force back in February 2016.

She graduated training earlier this year, and on Monday she reported for her first day as a Sub Inspector in the Law and Order unit at Choolaimedu police station.

When approached by the media outside her new place of work, Yashini said: “This is a dream come true.

“I have crossed several hurdles to reach where I am today.

“I promise to serve society without exhibiting any bias.”

During her first day of being an officer, her duties included going out on patrol in her station’s jurisdiction.

Asked about having Yashini on his team, the station’s Inspector told Times of India: “We will not be biased towards her and she will be treated on par with other police personnel.



“Since there are many transgender people in our jurisdiction, Yashini’s presence will be an advantage.”

On the ruling to allow trans people into the force, the judges involved said: “The social impact of such recruitment cannot be lost sight of, as it would give strength to the case of [transgender people].

“Yashini must reach the finish line, and not be stopped and disqualified in the middle.”

Since Yashini’s acceptance into the force, three more trans women have passed the police academy application process, and are soon due to become police officers themselves.
