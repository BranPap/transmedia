Transgender woman told by Sainsbury’s to use disabled toilet

A transgender woman in Surrey has described how staff at a Sainsbury’s supermarket told her to use the disabled toilets instead of the women’s facility.

Stephanie Collins, 55, told the Surrey Herald that she used the women’s toilets but as she came out, a staff member stopped her and told her she should not use them.

Miss Collins, who began transition two years ago, said: “I told the lady I was not disabled and suggested it would be inappropriate. She said ‘I can see that’ but told me to use the disabled toilet. 

“She became defensive. I was left feeling quite embarrassed and rather awkward, but I’m not angry but I feel sorry for Sainsbury’s if they cannot train up their staff to deal tactfully with people.”

The Sainsbury’s store, in The Heart, has not commented.

Last month, another trans woman was told not to use female toilets at Poole Stadium.

Victoria Saxe-Coburg, 55, was watching a speedway event between Poole Pirates and Wolverhampton Wolves on June 8th when security staff told her in front of other fans that there had been a complaint about her.

Ms Saxe-Coburg told the Bournemouth Echo she was so humiliated, she burst into tears.
