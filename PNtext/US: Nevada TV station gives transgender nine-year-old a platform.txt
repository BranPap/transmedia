US: Nevada TV station gives transgender nine-year-old a platform

In a piece detailing what Reno Pride meant to the LGBT community, Nevada news station KOLO 8 gave transgender nine-year-old Cee Cee Ott the opportunity to tell her story.

Cee Cee started displaying gender non-conforming behavior at 3-years-old.

Cee Cee said to the news station: “I wanted to be a girl at that time, but I couldn’t because at the time I was a boy, so I had to be there and dress up like a boy. It was miserable.”

Cee Cee’s parents, Shanna and Nicole Ott, homeschooled Cee Cee after she finished kindergarten in hopes of keeping her safe while letting her explore her gender identity.

Cee Cee said: “There’s not very many people who come and support people like that.”

Cee Cee aspires to be a surgeon specializing in transition-related surgeries so she can help other people like her.

She said to the station: “I can help people so they can stand out better and they don’t have to worry about hiding things.”

Nicole Ott said to KOLO 8: “We want our children to be happy and to be themselves and that’s all we care about. We’re not trying to make anyone be anything other than allowing them the space to figure out who they are and what they want from the world.”
