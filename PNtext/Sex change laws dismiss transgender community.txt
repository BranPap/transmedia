Sex change laws dismiss transgender community

Vietnam’s transgendered community has lost out in new laws which legalise sex changes only for androgynies.

The legislation allows people with both male and female genital features but means those with physically distinct sexual identities are still not allowed the surgery.

An androgynous person will be given new ID and legal documents.

The law will now be submitted for government approval.

Last week South Korea’s Supreme Court began to consider whether a 50 year old transsexual should be allowed to official change his gender.
