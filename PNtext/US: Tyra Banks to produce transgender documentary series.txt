US: Tyra Banks to produce transgender documentary series

Tyra Banks has signed on to produce a documentary about trans women, hosted by trans model Carmen Carrera.

TransAmerica, which will hosted by Carrera, will look at the different lives of trans women across America, and is slated to air on VH1 early next year.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, America’s Next Top Model host Tyra Banks will be an executive producer for the eight-part series.

Susan Levison, the network’s Executive VP for programming, said: “It would be easy to focus on the transgender aspect, but this series is about so much more.

“This is a show about a group of compelling, gorgeous young friends who are on a unique journey while staying true to their authentic selves. We believe that message resonates.”

Banks said: “TransAmerica is a groundbreaking docuseries that will blow the roof off stereotypes and set the record straight as we experience the lives of these fun, stunning women.

“I am so happy to be a part of telling their fierce story.”

Carrera, who starred on RuPaul’s Drag Race before revealing she was transgender, said: “Being a woman means everything to me.

“Before my transition I felt trapped, and now I’ve been set free. Carmen has arrived and I can’t wait to share my story.”

Banks was commended with a GLAAD award in 2009, winning praise for her advocacy of trans contestant Isis on America’s Next Top Model.

Orange is the New Black actress Laverne Cox is working on a separate documentary about trans teenagers, which is set to air on MTV and Logo this Autumn.
