Study estimates that 1.4 million Americans identify as transgender

A study has found that around 1.4 million Americans identify as transgender. 

While fluctuating state-by-state, the numbers from the Williams Institute study indicated that the number of adults openly identifying as transgender had doubled from a decade ago. 

The study estimates that 1.4 million, on average around 0.6 percent of the US population, openly identifies as trans.

“The findings from this study are critical to current policy discussions that impact transgender people,” said Jody Herman, an author of the study. 

“Policy debates on access to bathrooms, discrimination, and a host of other issues should rely on the best available data to assess potential impacts, including how many people may be affected.”

The area with the highest proportion of adults who identify as transgender was the District of Columbia, with 14,550 people, which amounts to 2.77 percent of the population. 

The states with the higest proportion of people who identify as trans were Hawaii, California, Georgia and New Mexico, with 0.8 percent. 

Various states have over 100,000 people who identify as trans, including Florida, California and Texas. 

North Dakota, Iowa, Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota only returned an average of 0.3 percent of the population identifying as trans. 

The study also found that young people, aged 18 to 24, were the most likely to identify as trans, with 0.7 percent saying they did. 

To compile their results, researchers at the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law drew on data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey as well as from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which includes representative surveys of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories.
