Caitlyn Jenner attacked by transgender activist as ‘a f***ing fraud’ for supporting Donald Trump

Caitlyn Jenner has been attacked by a barrier-breaking transgender activist who accused her of being a “f***ing fraud” for supporting Donald Trump.

Ashlee Marie Preston, who became the first trans magazine editor-in-chief earlier this year, ripped into Jenner for her allegedly ongoing backing of Trump despite his decision to ban trans people from the military.

The activist approached Jenner at an event by the Trans Chorus of Los Angeles on Saturday night for the confrontation, which she later uploaded to Facebook.

“You need to f***ing stay away,” she told Jenner. “No-one wants you here.

“It’s f***ing ridiculous. You’re a f***ing fraud.

“You continue to support somebody that does everything with the military that’s erasing our community,” Preston said to the Olympic gold medallist.

“That’s not community. It’s really f***ed up that you continue to support him.

“What makes me mad is I supported you, and so many of us supported you.

Turning to another attendee, she said: “We are complicit.

“Taking her money and doing all that, it makes us complicit and it goes against the mission.”



The guest asked Preston how the community is meant to fight anyone if it’s engaged in infighting.

Preston responded: “How are we gonna fight if she’s giving money to the people who are destroying us?

“As long as we both continue to be the ones impacted by the choices you make, it’s not okay. It’s not okay.”

Caitlyn muttered: “You don’t know me.”

Preston responded: “Yes I do. Oh my god. I’m getting so mad.

“No, no, no. It’s ridiculous. You’re a f***ing fraud and a fake.”

Preston posted the video on Facebook, tagging the reality star with the caption: “Caitlyn Jenner you’re trash”.

She also alleged on Twitter that “the Trans Chorus of Los Angeles took $25,000 from Caitlyn Jenner invited her here and gave her recognition… #MoneyOverMorale”.

Speaking to PinkNews, a TCLA spokesperson said: “There is a different side of this story to tell.

“The Trans Chorus of Los Angeles fiercely empowers trans people to love their voices and use them to change the social ecology. Including Ashlee Marie Preston’s.

“For the record, Ashlee Marie Preston is a former TCLA board of director who said nothing when the CJ Foundation offered the chorus a grant LAST MAY.”

Preston defended confronting Jenner, tweeting: “Desperate times call for desperate measures.

“A loud, angry black trans woman is more effective than a dead one. #SilenceIsDeath”.

Desperate times call for #desperate measures. A #loud, #angry #black #trans #woman” is more affective than a #dead one. #SilenceIsDeath

Jenner was photographed by TMZ wearing a red cap bearing Trump’s campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” just days after she condemned Trump for his trans military ban.

The reality star later explained it was all a big mishap, and promised to throw the red hat away.

She told TMZ: “What he’s doing to our community is absolutely f***ing awful. I apologise to all of the trans community.

“I made a mistake. I will never do it again and I’m getting rid of the hat.”
