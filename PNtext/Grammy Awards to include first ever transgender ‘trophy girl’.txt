Grammy Awards to include first ever transgender ‘trophy girl’

A transgender model will be the first ever trans person to serve as a ‘trophy girl’ at this weekend’s Grammys.

The 59th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony will be held on February 12, with an expected strong focus on diversity after criticism of lack of representation during 2016’s awards season.

Ahead of the show, it has been revealed that this year trans model Martina Robledo will be one of the trophy handlers that brings the trophies on stage to be presented.

The role is traditionally given to attractive young women, but this year the line-up will also include a man, Derek Marrocco.

Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy, said: “To be honest, the idea of a ‘trophy girl’ has felt antiquated for some time now.

“Who wrote that rule anyway? The ability to present a trophy has nothing to do with one’s gender.”

He added that the change was not meant to be “provocative”, but to acknowledge that “music’s universal power lies in its spirit of inclusion”.

Ms Robledo said: “I know it’s going to make some people uncomfortable and make others weep for joy.

“I’m just going to step out there and strut and make sure I deliver my best, because there’s people out there looking up to me.”
