Man glassed woman after discovering she was transgender during sex

A man has admitted attacking a transgender woman who was performing a sex act on him.

40-year-old construction worker Scott Allan appeared in Liverpool Crown Court over the incident, which left the trans woman bleeding and needing stitches.

The court heard that Allan and the victim had met in a bar on January 24 last year, before going back to a house with two other people.

When the victim ended up alone with Allan, she performed a sex act on him – but Allan became angry and attacked her with a wine glass.

According to the Liverpool Echo, prosecutor Fiona McNeill recalled: “She understood that the defendant realised that she was a transsexual.

“The defendant and her engaged in some flirtatious conduct and there was sexual contact between them.

“The defendant attempted to move his hand towards her genital area but she stopped him and he became upset.

“He shouted at the complainant words to the effect of ‘you’re a freak’ and ‘you’re a bearded lady.’”

Allan hit out at the victim and slashed her with a wine glass, and she was left with cuts to her right wrist and fingers.

The construction worker admitted causing the injuries, which the defence said were “a consequence of his loss of self control.”

According to the newspaper, Judge David Aubrey QC said: “While you admit pushing your victim in this case, it was not your intention and indeed it cannot be said that there was the necessary knowledge at the time that you had a glass in your hand.

“You accept that you did shout certain insults at your victim and were showing to your victim no tolerance whatsoever, irrespective as to that which had occurred prior.”

Allan was handed a nine-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to pay £1000 compensation.
