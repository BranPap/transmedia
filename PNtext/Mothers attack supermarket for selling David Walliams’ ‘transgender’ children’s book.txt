Mothers attack supermarket for selling David Walliams’ ‘transgender’ children’s book

A group of angry mothers have launched an attack against supermarket giants ALDI because the store stocks a “transgender” book by David Walliams.

A number of mothers have taken to social media to chastise the store over its decision to sell the short novel, The Boy in a Dress.



The book, which is Walliams’ first, tells the story of a twelve-year-old who likes to wear dresses and the reaction of his family and friends. The book, which is for eight to twelve-year-olds, aims to promote diversity and challenge gender roles.

Writing on ALDI Australias Facebook page one mother, Kathryn Woolley, said that she was “disappointed” by the decision to stock the book written by the British comedian.

She wrote: “Aldi – we are so very disappointed in your decision to stock a book within your store – relating to transgenderism in children!
“We would ask that you reconsider your choice to sell it!

“Family & children must be protected in times where there are those whose agenda is to groom & sexualise them!

“We ask you to have a conscience in this matter!”

Wooley’s post sparked a debate, with many supporting her stance.

One person wrote: “As a loyal customer I am extremely disappointed to find that you are actively promoting a book called The Boy in the Dress by David Walham.”



A different person added: “This is disturbing. ALDI’s concern should be to sell quality products to the customer and provide a good service (which you do).

“However you have now overstepped the line. Your role is not to propagate sexually confusing material to minors.”

Despite the transphobic comments, a number of people came to the defence of the store and celebrated the decision to stock the book.

One person wrote: “If you don’t like it, don’t buy it… but I for one think it’s great – if the “worst” my kids do is dress or behave in ways that don’t conform to gender norms I’ll be a happy mum indeed, and if these books help a child struggling with their identity find some comfort (whether it my child or yours), I think they’re worth their weight in gold…”

Another added: “I just wanted to say I’ll definitely be grabbing a copy. Keep doing what you’re doing, Aldi!”

“I rarely shop at Aldi but shall make a point of going there this week and hope I can grab a copy of this awesome book!” a third wrote.
