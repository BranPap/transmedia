Avon’s first transgender rep reveals how ‘the sisterhood’ helped her with her identity

A 35-year-old woman who quit her full-time job to care for her mother has become Avon’s first transgender representative.

Daniella Schofield, from Blackpool, joined Avon in February because she needed to work flexible hours around caring for her mum.

Schofield now manages a team of 21 Avon representatives and says working for the beauty company helped her feel “accepted” as a woman.

Schofield previously worked as a care-home manager but left her job when her mother, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia 10 years ago, began to need round-the-clock support.

Schofield also said her transition was “challenging” and “extremely tough”, adding that it “does get easier”.
