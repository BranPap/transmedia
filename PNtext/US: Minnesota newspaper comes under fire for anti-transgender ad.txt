US: Minnesota newspaper comes under fire for anti-transgender ad

Minnesota’s Star Tribune is receiving criticism for running a full-page anti-transgender ad in Sunday’s paper.

The ad reads: “A male wants to shower beside your 14-year-old daughter. Are YOU ok with that?”

Paid for by the Minnesota Child Protection League (MCPL), the ad is a response to a proposed policy change by the Minnesota State High School League that would allow inclusion for transgender athletes.

The proposed policy would allow transgender students to participate in the gendered team of their choosing with physician documentation and, in some instances, having begun hormone therapy.

Nebraska and South Dakota have adopted similar inclusion policies.

Earlier this year, the MCPL also actively opposed the anti-bullying Safe And Supportive Schools Act before it was signed into law.

The Minnesota State High School League is scheduled to vote on the policy Wednesday.
