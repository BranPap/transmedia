Rock singer Yungblud shares heartwarming story from transgender fan who inspired a song on his new album

Yungblud has revealed that a track on new album was inspired by a transgender fan.

In an interview with The Sun, the 22-year-old rock singer revealed how a chance meeting with a fan inspired ‘Mars’, a track on his upcoming album.

He said: “There’s a song called ‘Mars’ which is important to me because I had a trans man come up to me and say my track ‘Kill Somebody’ last year helped his parents with the community he wanted to be in.

“[It] allowed him to go from being a girl – they sat with him through his transition to be a boy. I thought that was f**king crazy.

“He told me about his story, about how nobody understood him, and it clicked with me because it reminded me of ‘Life On Mars’ by David Bowie – so I’m paying homage to that.”

He added of the upcoming album: “It’s kind of a nod to Bowie, and it’s stories about young people.”

The singer, real name Dominic Harrison, spoke to Notion Magazine last month about his open approach to sexuality.

He said: “In terms of sexuality, I want to be an advocate for relaying the idea that you can love whoever the f**k you want to love without judgement at all, and you can identify any way you want to identify and no one should judge you for it.

“To love and be loved in return is everybody’s single handed right. If people want to call me [a sex symbol] then sick — I’m sexy.”

He added: “I wanna be the rock star for the 2020 generation.

“People always advise me, ‘Don’t say that you want to be something, just in case you don’t turn out to be it.’

“But I’m not afraid to say that I wanna be the rock kid for them. I hate it when people say, ‘Rock isn’t cool’. Rock is so f***ing cool. Pouring your heart out is cool.”
