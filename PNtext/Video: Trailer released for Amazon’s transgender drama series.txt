Video: Trailer released for Amazon’s transgender drama series

A trailer has been released for Amazon’s new trans-based drama series, Transparent.

The show is set to launch on on September 26, with a 10-episode series on Amazon Prime Instant Video.

It follows Maura (played by Jeffrey Tambor), who reveals to her ex-wife and grown children that she is transitioning to female.

The show also stars Gaby Hoffman, Amy Landecker and Jay Duplass as Maura’s children, while Judith Light plays her wife.

In the clip, Maura says: “All my life, I’ve been dressing up like a man… and this is me.”

The trailer has received a mixed reaction, with some trans groups criticising the casting of a cisgender male actor in the role of a trans woman, while others have praised the big-budget series for focussing on the life of an older trans person.

The show’s creator Jill Soloway said: “There’s so much confusion around what it means to be trans! I feel so excited to be able to tell stories that will illuminate the difference between somebody who may be medically transitioning, or somebody who may be socially transitioning; somebody who’s a cross dresser, somebody who’s inter gender, somebody who’s a butch lesbian, somebody who’s a drag queen — all these categories sometimes fall under the umbrella of ‘trans’.

“I see so many people watching their teenage children transition, their parents transition, their cousins, brothers, and saying ‘well, you’re not the person I remember’; holding onto these ideas of your identity within your family of origin.

“It’s is a great metaphor for all the ways our parents don’t stay put where we wanted them to be, or our kids don’t stay where we want them to be.”

Soloway is no stranger to provocative shows, having served as showrunner on ‘United States of Tara’, which dealt with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID).

Earlier this week, BBC2 commissioned a trans-based sitcom, Boy Meets Girl, following a talent search within the trans community.
