Two transgender women allegedly gang-raped while two others are brutally beaten

Two transgender women have allegedly been gang-raped in their own home, with two other trans women left brutally beaten.

A group of five men reportedly broke into a house rented by a group of trans women in Karachi, Pakistan.

When the women refused to entertain them, the men subjected them to physical and sexual abuse, according to activist organisation Trans Action Pakistan.

A provincial coordinator for the Sindh Transgender Network, Ihsan Ali, told news outlet Dawn that two of the trans women were gang-raped by five men.

Three of the alleged attackers have been identified, while the others remain unknown.

Incidents such as this are still common in the socially conservative Muslim nation, despite attempts earlier this month to bring forward a bill which aims to protect trans people.

Ali accused the police of being negligent in investigating the case.

“Police only took a complaint application,” he said.

“They did not even order a physical examination, which is a basic requirement for any rape case.

“Neither have they visited the area in the past five days,” Ali added.



He said that the group was planning to petition a court to get the police to register the incident.

“Protests are also being planned for Wednesday,” he continued – “not just for this case, but also for other incidents that have taken place in the city against members of the transgender community in the past week.”

A 25-year-old trans woman named only as Chanda was shot dead in Karachi last week.

A group of men threw rotten eggs at trans people standing together in the street, before opening fire on them.

Another man has reportedly been arrested for allegedly harassing, torturing and raping several trans people in Karachi.
