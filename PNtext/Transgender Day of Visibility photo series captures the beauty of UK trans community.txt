Transgender Day of Visibility photo series captures the beauty of UK trans community

A photo series encapsulating the myriad of the powerful trans community in the UK has been released to celebrate the UK Transgender Day of Visibility (TDOV).

As the trans community is thrust into the forefront of the media spotlight, often the conversation about trans rights can dissipate into hateful rhetoric and misunderstanding that forgets the people at the centre of the narrative.

That’s why Adobe Stock has partnered with self-taught photographer Bex Day to create a collection of images to celebrate the UK’s transgender community so trans people can have appropriate visual representation in the media.

 

 

“I’m excited to get involved in this series as it is important to shine a light on Britain’s trans community,” said photographer Bex Day.

“As the world is evolving at a rapid rate it’s important that Stock contributors continue to document current affairs, especially those that can make a difference.”



 

 

“Adobe is committed to expanding the range and diversity of images available in Adobe Stock, and ensuring there is a more authentic representation of the transgender community is an important part of that,” said Ryan Levitt, Senior Communications Manager at Adobe EMEA.

We are working with some truly inspirational contributors to bring this to life in Adobe Stock, with our latest focus on the Fluid Self an exciting opportunity to help challenge harmful myths and stereotypes about people from different backgrounds. Bex Day’s collection is a fantastic addition to the library.”
