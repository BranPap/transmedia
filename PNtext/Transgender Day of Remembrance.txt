Transgender Day of Remembrance

Today is the 11th International Transgender Day of Remembrance.

The yearly event is held to recognise and remember trans people who have been killed through hatred or prejudice.

According to transgenderdor.org, it is estimated that 117 trans people worldwide have been murdered this year, although it is expected the actual figure is higher.

In the UK, two trans women have been murdered in the last few weeks. 

Andrea Waddell was found dead in her Brighton flat on October 15th, while Destiny Lauren was found strangled at her Kentish Town, London, home on November 5th. A motive for their deaths has not yet been confirmed.

Events are being held around the world to remember them and others like them.

In London, a vigil will be held tomorrow from 2.15pm at the 52 Club, Gower Street.

Other events around the country are as follows:
