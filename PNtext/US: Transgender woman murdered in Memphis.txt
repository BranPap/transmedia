US: Transgender woman murdered in Memphis

A transgender woman has been found murdered in Memphis, Tennessee.

Alejandra Leos was shot dead just steps away from her home in Berkshire, late on Friday night.

Police misgendered her in initial reports, but her family told WREG that she was a transgender woman.

Family friend Melisa Smith said that Leos’ mother, Irma Caballerro, was still in shock following the killing.

She said: “She doesn’t have any words right now. She’s still in shock, and we’re all still in shock.

“I knew her, it was like my family.”

Family members believe that someone had been harassing Leos prior to her death.

Police say that the investigation into the killing is ongoing, but that they have not identified the shooter.

However, a police spokesperson declined to say whether the killing was being treated as a potential hate crime.

Describing the woman’s kindness, Smith said: “‘You don’t have a jacket? I’ll give it to you’.

“It was to the point where if you didn’t have no place to sleep [Alejandra] would help you.”
