Target faces boycott from lots of people who don’t understand what transgender means

After changing its policy to support trans people who want to use a gender appropriate bathroom, Target is now being criticised from those who don’t understand what being transgender means.

The retail giant on Tuesday said customers at its stores may use the bathroom which is appropriate to their gender identity, not the sex stated on their birth certificate, as dictated by such laws.



Target released a statement reading: “In our stores, we demonstrate our commitment to an inclusive experience in many ways.

“Most relevant for the conversations currently underway, we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity.”

The brand has also said it supports the federal Equality Act, protecting LGBT+ against discrimination.

Now the American Family Association (AFA), which is being known for vehemently opposing anything positive on LGBT issues, has urged followers to boycott the store over the new policy.

The AFA, clearly completely misunderstanding a) the policy and b) what it means to be trans, said that the new policy will “allow men to use the women’s restrooms and dressing rooms in their stores.”

The statement went on to say that the policy allows a sexual predator that he could “simply say he ‘feels like a woman today’ and enter the women’s restroom … even if young girls or women are already in there.”

“Clearly, Target’s new policy poses a danger to wives and daughters,” AFA warned. “We think many customers will agree. And we think the average Target customer is willing to pledge to boycott Target stores until it makes protecting women and children a priority.”

A few people, who also don’t understand the point of the policy, have commented on Target’s Facebook page to say they will no longer shop at the store.
