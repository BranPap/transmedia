Transgender barber Max Cresham died by suicide after suffering from depression and anxiety

A 25-year-old transgender man called Max Cresham died by suicide, an inquest has heard.

Max Cresham, from Northwich, Cheshire, had been recovering from top surgery and had reportedly complained of suffering from “low moods” in the lead up to his death.

He died on July 20 last year.

The inquest recorded a conclusion of suicide, with assistant coroner Peter Sigee saying “he had the intention to end his life”.

The inquest heard that Cresham was “full of wit, humour and joy”.

He had come out as trans in 2017, started hormone treatment in 2018 and had top surgery with a private gender clinic in 2019.

Almost half of young trans people have attempted death by suicide, according to Stonewall research.

The Samaritans are the UK’s suicide reduction charity and their free helpline number is 116 123.
