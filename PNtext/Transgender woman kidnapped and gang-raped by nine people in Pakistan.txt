Transgender woman kidnapped and gang-raped by nine people in Pakistan

A transgender woman has been kidnapped and gang-raped by at least nine people.

Sources told The Express Tribune that the woman in Peshawar, Pakistan was attacked because she was advocating for trans rights.

The individual has remained anonymous, as she is scared for her life.

This inhumane attack isn’t an isolated incident.

There have been multiple instances of transgender people being shot in Peshawar.

Rights activist Taimur Kamal said that many crimes against LGBT people in Peshawar were being committed by an organised gang.

“Law enforcers are reluctant to take action against the gang despite the series of attacks,” he added.

This claim was supported by activist, Qamar Naseem, who said that when trans person was shot dead, the police didn’t assist the victim with any medical attention.

Earlier this month, a transgender victim called Sonia was rushed to hospital in a critical condition after being shot.

In August last year, a trans person was shot dead after a gang of armed men opened fire on a group of trans people in Karachi.



And in September, two trans women were allegedly gang-raped in their own home whilst two others were brutally beaten.

Despite Pakistan introducing a bill to protect transgender individuals against these crimes last December, the threat of violence towards the marginalised group is still present.

But despite the ongoing attacks, the country has still made small progressive steps in the right direction over the last year.

In January last year, the Lahore High Court ruled that trans people would be included in Pakistan’s national census for the first time.

And in June, Pakistan granted its first gender neutral passport.

Allama lgbal Open University University also offered trans people free education in October.
