Kim Kardashian on Bruce Jenner transgender rumours: ‘We support him no matter what’

Kim Kardashian has addressed rumours about her step parent Bruce Jenner having transitioned to female, saying she and their family would support them “no matter what”.

Speaking to ET Online, Kardashian said Jenner is “the happiest” she’s ever seen them.

In Touch magazine was condemned last week after it published a photoshopped cover featuring claims that the former Olympic gold medallist has transitioned to female. Despite Jenner not commenting on any of the rumours, the magazine carried the headline “My Life as a Woman”

The Kardashians responded to the cover my posting a photo of themselves, Kim, Kendall, Kylie, Kourtney and Khloe, surrounding Jenner on a couch, with the caption “family first”.

Kim told ET Online: “Well we support Bruce no matter what, so we were just at his house hanging out and we wanted to take a picture, that was not like a secret message like, ‘We support Bruce…Of course we support Bruce 100%.”

She went on: “He’s our dad so we support him no matter what, and I think when the time is right, he’ll talk about whatever he wants to talk about. I just think it’s his story to talk about, not really mine.”

Activist Janet Mock said on MSNBC: “Let’s be clear. This is not Jenner’s story. Jenner has not stepped forward as a woman or uttered a word about being transgender.

Russell Brand also laid into media outlets including TMZ for speculating about Jenner’s gender identity.
