Have a very lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered Christmas

Festive greetings from all at PinkNews.co.uk, The Pink News and our publishing partners 3Sixty.

The team being a mixed bunch of sexualities, genders and religions, we know that everyone spends this time of year in a different way.

For Christan readers we wish a Merry Christmas and wish for the New Year to dawn a new age within all the church’s many denominations.

For those of other faiths and those of none, we wish you a peaceful new year free of discrimination.

To the readers that sent us both Chanukah and Christmas cards thank you and we look forward to 2007 being another award winning year for PinkNews.co.uk.

Enjoy the bank holidays and we’ll be back in service on Wednesday 27th December (emergencies excepted).
