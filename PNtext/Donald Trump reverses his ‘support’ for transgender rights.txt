Donald Trump reverses his ‘support’ for transgender rights

Donald Trump has rescinded his support for transgender rights.

A wave of Republican-backed ‘bathroom bills’ have spread across the US aimed at rolling back LGBT rights protections, ostensibly to stop transgender people from using their preferred bathroom.

Republican Presidential nominee Donald Trump had initially broken with his party’s official stance, claiming last month that trans people should be allowed to use the bathroom that they want.

Asked if he would be fine with Caitlyn Jenner using the women’s bathroom at Trump Tower, he had replied: “That is correct”.

However, as he bids for unity with the Republican bigwigs, the billionaire has walked back his stance, claiming earlier this month: “It’s a new issue and right now I just don’t have an opinion, but what I would like to do is see the states make that decision.”

Appearing on the Jimmy Kimmel Live last night, Trump walked his stance back even further, suggesting that states like North Carolina should be free to set their own anti-LGBT laws without government interference.

Trump said: “The party generally believes that whatever you’re born, that’s the bathroom you use. I say let the states decide.”

Pushed on his own stance, he said: “What I support is let the states decide, and I think the states will do hopefully the right thing.”

Asked what ‘the right thing’ actually is, he said: “I don’t know yet, I don’t know. It’s a very interesting subject.

“Something has to be discussed but I say let the states decide.”

Leaving the issue to the states means that Republican-controlled legislatures would be free to implement ‘bathroom bans’ at will.
