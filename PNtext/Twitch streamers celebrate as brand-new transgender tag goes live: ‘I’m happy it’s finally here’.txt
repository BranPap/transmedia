Twitch streamers celebrate as brand-new transgender tag goes live: ‘I’m happy it’s finally here’

Twitch announced the news of the tags last weekend and streamers were elated to finally be able to tag their streams accordingly. Now those tags are officially available to use.

In their latest “Let’s Chat” stream hosted by Senior Director of Marketing Erin ‘Aureylian’ Wayne, Twitch went into detail on the tags.

“I also wanted to take a moment on behalf of Twitch and personally to sincerely thank our community and especially our trans community for their persistence, for the continued feedback and for the patience that they’ve displayed over the past several years while we have been working on the launch of these tags,” said Wayne.

“Your contributions and especially your activism have been incredibly powerful and absolutely inspiring and it’s the work that you do, the work of our community, that continues to make Twitch the place that it is and better and better as we go forward.”

The stream included guests from Twitch to discuss the purpose and reasoning behind the new Twitch tags and address why it took so long.

“We were wrong not to have done it sooner,” admitted Tom Verrilli, VP of Viewer Experience, who said they spent too long seeking a “great” solution instead of going ahead with a “good” one that can be improved.

The list of tags was also chosen to be as inclusive as possible, which took time to put together. This involved speaking with the community and third-party organisations to ensure tags are culturally appropriate.

The video also includes a chat with Global VP of Trust and Safety Angela Hession who enforced the importance of Twitch’s existing code of conduct and moderation tools in notifying Twitch of toxic behaviour that could arise from using the tags.

There is more to be done, but Twitch is listening to feedback from its community. You can watch the full video on Twitch here.

The full list of Twitch tags can be found here, which includes individual tags for multiple identities within the LGBT+ community. 

It’s a long list but not exhaustive, as Twitch has recognised. Suggestions can be listed on User Voice where there are already multiple petitions.

Already many streamers have offered suggestions for Twitch tags that are missing, both on User Voice and on Twitter.

For the most part, though, streamers are elated to finally be able to use tags on their streams that match their identity.

Also first stream with the Transgender tag tonight felt right. It just felt right. <3

You will not believe how many people I spoke to today who found me via the Trans Tag.
I'm happy it's finally here. I'm happy there's a tool for discovery. Definitely not a solution for Twitches broken system but it's something.
It's something.

I am very happy and excited that trans individuals and so many other people can now be represented. I admit to being unhappy with the tag limit, but I hope that Twitch doesn't put that on the backburner and that they implement that AND missing identity tags. 💜

one of my first experiences of the Twitch trans tag has been watching someone come out ✨live✨, their parents showing up in chat to support and everyone showing so much love and hyping each other up.
Safe to say I've come around to the whole tag thing 😭😭

One major improvement that’s required, however, is the need to use more than five tags. This limit does not allow for intersectionality, especially as Twitch tags are used to denote both content and identity.

Ok, but we could really use more tag slots, @Twitch @TwitchSupport ! There are more ways to identify ourselves and our stream spaces, it would be helpful to up the limit from 5 tags. https://t.co/BRqPr60YPy

This is a good day but let's have more than 5 tag spaces!
If you've got no backseating, no spoilers, first playthrough & family friendly on, you're left with 1 space for an identity tag.
They need to be separate or at least increase the limit. https://t.co/sGBXlVxKZd

.@twitch @TwitchSupport is there any chance that the 5 tag limit might be increased to 10 in the future?

Twitch did address this in their video. The limit of five is for design reasons, to increase discoverability, and for diminishing returns in adding more and more tags to a stream.

The team is also aware of gatekeeping which parts of your identity you can express on stream, though they will continue to explore options in this area.
