Transgender Scrabble champ took her own life to escape abuse, inquest hears

An inquest into the death of a transgender Scrabble champion has heard that she received regular abuse on the streets of Carlisle.

36-year-old Mikki Nicholson, who made headlines in 2010 when she was crowned UK Scrabble Champion – died on November 7 last year, when she stepped in front of a train.

Ms Nicholson, who was female but never gained legal gender recognition, spent time in psychiatric care months prior to her death, an inquest in Carlisle heard.

Prior to her death she had to leave her temporary accommodation – despite having been unable to find a new home – and was recorded as “intentionally homeless”.

According to the News and Star, community psychiatric nurse Clive Guyo said: “She described Carlisle as hostile to people who are different.

“She spoke of facing verbal abuse while walking in the streets because of how she appeared to other people.

“Schoolchildren were often the worst for making fun of her and verbally abusing her.

“She had a negative view of Carlisle based on past experience… she felt stigmatised.”

The corner recorded the death as deliberate, but found she had been well supported by the psychiatric services.
