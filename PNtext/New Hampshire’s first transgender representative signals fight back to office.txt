New Hampshire’s first transgender representative signals fight back to office

A transgender New Hampshire state representative, who resigned last month, says she will stand again for election next year.

Stacie Laughton of Nashua, New Hampshire, quit just weeks after being elected when her criminal past was exposed by a local newspaper.

The crimes dated back to several years ago, before Ms Laughton had transitioned from male to female, they included a 2008 conviction for conspiracy to commit credit card fraud and slashing tires.

The Laconia Daily Sun claimed the 28-year-old also admitted to faking an illness to get a ride from an ambulance.

WMUR-TV reports earlier this week, the New Hampshire Executive Council scheduled a special election for April 2013.

Ms Laughton said she’ll file as a candidate the day after Christmas.

In November, she had indicated her reluctance to resign from office, saying on Facebook:

“I didn’t want to have to do this, There’s been a lot of people that have said stay strong, keep your head up, stay in it.

“It’s going to be difficult to be able to do that in this upcoming session, and to possibly face expulsion.”
