Transgender woman stabbed in Hollywood hate crime attack

A transgender woman has been stabbed in Hollywood in what police are describing as a possible hate crime.

The victim, who has not been identified, was reportedly stabbed in both arms before fleeing the scene but is expected to make a recovery.

The attack took place shortly before 2am local time under the 101 Freeway at Franklin Avenue in Los Angeles.

Police said the suspect fled the scene and a description of the attacker has not been released.

The victim was walking alone and talking on a phone when the attack took place.

According to Human Rights Watch, there have been 113 incidents of fatal violence against transgender and non-binary people since 2013. Of those killed, 64 were victims of gun violence.

In 2017, at least 26 transgender people were killed in the US and the majority of the victims were trans women of colour.

Human rights groups have warned the number of victims could be higher, as this does not include trans victims whose deaths were not reported due to misgendering in police reports, news stories or by their families.

The current rate of trans killings in 2018 is the same as last year.
