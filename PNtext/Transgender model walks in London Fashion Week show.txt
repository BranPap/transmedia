Transgender model walks in London Fashion Week show

Transgender model Nicole Gibson has appeared on the runway at London Fashion Week, just days before undergoing gender confirmation surgery.

Ms Gibson, who only began hormone replacement therapy two years ago, took part in the Catwalk for Change campaign for Models for Diversity, a fashion showcase that seeks to promote diversity within the industry.

After starting hormone replacement therapy, Ms Gibson left her job working at a pub in Horsham, West Sussex, and began pursuing a career in the modelling industry.

“The fashion show was amazing,” said Ms Gibson. “They say you have not really made it as a model until you walk along the catwalk in a sheer dress with your nipples showing, and here I was doing it in my first show! Luckily, thanks to the hormones, I have quite a nice pair now. I didn’t have time to get nervous, I was just so excited.”

Speaking to reporters about being transgender, Ms Gibson said: “To me it is just something that I have to do.

“It is like having two horns on my head that I have to get rid of to become the person that I have always felt I was inside.”

Following her successful appearance at London Fashion Week, Ms Gibson has been booked to appear at the Ideal Home Show later this year.

She may hope to emulate the success of Brazilian trans model Lea T, who earlier this year appeared in a global advertising campaign by United Colors of Benetton.
