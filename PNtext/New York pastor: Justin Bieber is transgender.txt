New York pastor: Justin Bieber is transgender

A New York pastor has claimed that pop singer Justin Bieber is actually transgender, and regrets “cutting off” his breasts.

Pastor James David Manning of the ATLAH Missionary Church in Harlem, New York, made the claims in a YouTube video.

He said: “These young girls, if we don’t stand, can be led to cut off their breasts once they get into puberty. They can be led to have operations like Justin Bieber. They can think the best choice in life is to cut off their breasts.

“By the time they reach the age of 20 years old, they look and say ‘I wish I had never cut off my breasts, I wish I had never mutilated my flesh, I wish I had never cut off my penis, I wish I had never done that, I was just young’.

“I will not as a pastor allow that to be said by any child that’s under my leadership.

“I will chase every sodomite, I will chase every lesbo, I will chase every political leader with the power of God, with the chariots of fire, that these children be not misled by people in congregations and people in business or politics like Obama.

“They’re influencing these children to throw their lives away the way Justin Bieber threw his life away, and then 20 years old, can’t grow their breasts back. We need to wake the hell up.”

Mr Manning has previously alleged that Vladimir Putin will ‘out’ Barack Obama as gay, and claimed that Starbucks flavours coffees with the semen of sodomites.

He has also admitted that he has been “tempted” by the gay lifestyle.
