10-year challenge: Twitter flooded with amazing transgender glo-ups

Transgender people have taken over the popular puberty Twitter hashtags #2009vs2019 and #HowHardDidPubertyHitYou for the recent 10-year challenge that has gone viral on social media.

Trans users own the hashtags in the best way, with stunning pre and post-transition glo-ups.

Posting photos of yourself 10 years apart is one of the major trends of early 2019, but when it comes to hashtags and memes, Queer Twitter does it better than anyone else.

That fact remains just as true in 20BiTeen, as trans tweeters have shown by gifting us with a deluge of pictures which show how happy transitioning can make you.

When captioning their incredible #HowHardDidPubertyHitYou glo-ups, a large number of trans people commented that puberty hit them harder than most because it happened to them twice due to their transition.

One wrote: “2009 to 2019. I think being openly trans makes this aging challenge especially weird because I get two puberties to look different.

“It’s basically cheating ,” they joked.

Another trans tweeter asked “#HowHardDidPubertyHitYou?” before answering: “It hit me twice but the first time was wack .”

One user said: “I did puberty twice you got nothing on me .”

“10 years in time and dang puberty hit so hard it hit me twice ,” said a different user.

Everyone was extremely happy with that fact, though.



“I technically hit puberty twice and you know what I can’t complain #HowHardDidPubertyHitYou #transisbeautiful,” wrote one such commenter.

Another tweeted: “#HowHardDidPubertyHitYou Well, my first one didn’t do much but here’s my second one!”

And a different trans user said: “#HowHardDidPubertyHitYou Thankfully puberty came for me twice .”

Others tweeted that “it hit me twice and I’m much happier with my second puberty” and “Doing puberty twice did me sooo good.”

As well as the heartwarming trans glo-ups, the hashtags also contain a lot of LGB people who are extremely proud of how far they’ve come in accepting their true selves.

One of these happy tweeters joked: “#HowHardDidPubertyHitYou, it hit the straight outta me.”

Another said: “#2009vs2019 Well just say I got a lot hotter & a lot gayer .”

A different tweeter captioned their photos with the quip: “When you just look more gay over time.”

Others compared the way in which puberty hit them to different gay, heavy objects.

Various commenters said it struck them “like a gay truck,” “like a big ol gay bus” and “like a ton of gay ass rave bricks.”

And another tweeter wrote that puberty came through “like a good ole Christian finding out they kid is gay .”
