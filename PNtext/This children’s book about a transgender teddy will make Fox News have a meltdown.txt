This children’s book about a transgender teddy will make Fox News have a meltdown

A new children’s book is being produced, which explores issues faced by transgender people.



Inspired after her father came out as trans, Jessica Walton created ‘Teddy: a book about being yourself, and being a good friend!’.



Teddy is sad, and Errol can’t work out why!

The book, now almost fully funded on Kickstarter, explores the story of Teddy, later known as Tilly, and her transition.

It explores friendship dynamics, as Tilly comes out to the people around her.

The Australian author writes on the page that she was able to find many books with gay parents, but not many with trans or genderfluid characters.



Errol is relieved that nothing is wrong. ‘I’ll always be your friend!’ he tells Teddy.

She said: “We felt that there must be more families out there with transgender grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles, siblings, cousins and friends who would appreciate a gentle, positive story with a transgender character.”



The book tells a story of friendship and coming out

In an inspiring way, the book hopes to introduce trans issues in a gentle way.

One line from the book reads: “Errol calls his cousin Ava. When Ava meets them at the park, she greets Teddy as Thomas. Errol explains that Teddy is a girl, and introduces her as Tilly. ‘What a lovely name!’ says Ava, ‘Let’s go and play!’ The three of them have fun at the park together.”

Spoiler alert – the book ends with Errol and Tilly going on as normal – showing they are still the best of friends and that nothing has changed.
