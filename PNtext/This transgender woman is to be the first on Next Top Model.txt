This transgender woman is to be the first on Next Top Model

Britain’s Next Top Model is to get its first ever trans contestant.

The new series of the long-running talent contest has models of all sorts of descriptions over the years.

But never before has it featured a transgender model.

This year that’s changing – with the inclusion of Talulah-Eve Brown.

The 22-year-old is the current holder of the Miss Transgender Birmingham title.

She seems to fancy her chances on the show, explaining in her opening VT that she’s “versatile”, “instantly recognisable” and believes there’s “no one like her” around.

She spoke to PA Real Life in 2015 of life as a trans model: “The level of abuse I get is hurtful, but if I was to report every instance of hate crime I’ve experienced to the police, I would be in court every single day.

“Instead, I just hold my head up high. There have been times where I could have potentially been beaten up, but I refuse to hide away and let these people see that they’ve upset me.

“I don’t want to feel like a victim because it isn’t me with the problem. I’m not any less of a person just because I’m transgender.”

It isn’t Miss Brown’s first time in modelling and showbiz.

She previously worked as an ambassador for Marie Claire’s Break Free campaign in 2016.

Trans models have been making their way on to the cat walk and in modelling houses in recent years.

Nepali model Anjali Lama recently became the first transgender model wo walk the runway at India’s fashion week.

She described the groundbreaking experience at Lakme Fashion Week as a “dream come true”.

High street chain Urban Outfitters also featured a trans model in one of their campaigns.
