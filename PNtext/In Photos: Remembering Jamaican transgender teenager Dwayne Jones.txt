In Photos: Remembering Jamaican transgender teenager Dwayne Jones

A vigil was held outside the Jamaican Embassy in London on Wednesday afternoon in memory of Jamaican transgender teenager Dwayne Jones.

The 16-year-old was stabbed multiple times and shot at a party in the Jamaican suburban parish of St James in July.

Police have yet to make a single arrest.

The Out and Proud Diamond Group (OPDG), in association with the Peter Tatchell Foundation organised the vigil.
