Mother goes viral with ‘It’s a boy!’ photoshoot for transgender son

A mum from Louisville, Kentucky, has thrown a gender reveal “It’s a boy!” party for her son’s twentieth birthday after he came out as transgender.

Heather Green posted photos of her family marking the occasion with her son, Adrian Brown, 20, on Facebook on January 29.

The post quickly went viral and has so far been liked by nearly 30,000 people and shared by more than 16,000 users.

“When your child comes out as trans, the best thing to do is create a photo shoot to celebrate the fact that he silently and bravely stepped out of the race that he never wanted to be in, found his own lane and proceeded to win,” Green wrote.

“HAPPY 20TH BIRTHDAY, Adrian! You are without a doubt the most fascinating human I know and I will always be your biggest fan!

“I love you, I honor who you are and I respect your courage to be unapologetically you!! Lets celebrate!!”

—Heather Green, Adrian Brown’s mum


In one photo, Brown can be seen holding blue balloons and a sign that reads “It’s a boy.”

In another, he lies beside a giant teddy under a blanket.

Green, meanwhile, poses in photos with a fake baby bump while holding the blue balloons.

Facebook users praised Green for celebrating her son coming out as trans.



One person wrote: “This is the best thing I’ve ever seen in my life!!! Congrats!!!”

Another said: “This is so special. What a beautiful family! Congrats Adrian!”

And a third person posted: “This is beyond incredible! Congrats to all of you on the love that so clearly is the foundation of your family. Bravo! And HAPPY BIRTHDAY!”

Green and Brown’s photoshoot has been picked up by news outlets worldwide, including Huffington Post, Yahoo Australia, and Metro.
