Mother of transgender girl says adults, not children, taunt her

The mother of a ten-year-old transgender girl in Worcester has told how adults, rather than children, taunt and harass her daughter.

The 36-year-old woman, who has not been named to protect her daughter’s identity, told the Worcester News that while the girl’s classmates had largely accepted her, other parents and adults had not.

The ten-year-old was born physically male and has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. 

Her family took the decision over the summer to allow her to return to school as a girl and say her headteacher has been “fantastic” about the issue.

Her mother, who said the child had shown signs of being transgender at two, said her daughter was called a “freak” by an adult when she went to a local shop during the summer.

Although she said there had been some bullying from other children, most had accepted her daughter as a girl.

But she said: “We went to a performance at the school and my daughter went as herself.

“Some of the parents were unhappy she was allowed to go into the school. They were walking past, coughing, and saying, ‘That’s that freak family. That’s that freak child’.”

She added: “I don’t expect people to understand. I just don’t want people abusing my child.

“I don’t want her to be called a freak. I want her to be left alone.”
