Education chief accused of discrimination against transgender teacher

Philip Morgan, former education, training and employment manager for Brighton and Hove City Council, has been charged with unacceptable professional conduct.

A disciplinary hearing heard that Mr Morgan discriminated against a transgender teacher, refusing to give a reference to her and referring to her as both “he” and “she”. 

Mr Morgan appeared before a General Teaching Council for England disciplinary panel in Birmingham.

The case against Mr Morgan focuses on a fax he allegedly sent in November 2003 to Hays Educational Personell, following a request to the council for a reference letter.

The fax reportedly contains several comments about the teacher which made her gender realignment clear.

The case was then adjourned. No date has been set for when the panel will give its verdict.
