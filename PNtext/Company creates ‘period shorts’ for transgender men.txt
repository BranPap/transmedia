Company creates ‘period shorts’ for transgender men

A company has launched a special range of period-absorbing male underwear, for transgender men who still menstruate.

New York-based underwear brand THINX created the unique brand after launching its original absorbent”underwear for women with periods”, which are specially designed to avoid leakage.

However, the company says its eyes were opened when customers pointed out that periods weren’t just for women – and that transgender men often struggle to find sanitary products.

For trans men on hormones, taking testosterone often halts periods – but menstruation can be particularly traumatic for men when it does happen.

THINX CEO Miki Agrawal told Mashable: “We hadn’t given a lot of thought to it, which is not super surprising given the lack of trans male visibility even now. Women aren’t the only people with periods. Many transgender men menstruate as well.

“If our goal is to break this taboo and eliminate the shame associate with periods globally, we’ve got to do that for everyone.”

Model and actor Sawyer DeVuyst explained: “A lot of people don’t realise that some men do get their periods because it’s just not talked about.

“There’s a lack of trans male visibility and within that visibility, nobody is talking about periods or menstruation because it is a source of shame.

“It strips away masculinity because it’s viewed as a very feminine thing.”
