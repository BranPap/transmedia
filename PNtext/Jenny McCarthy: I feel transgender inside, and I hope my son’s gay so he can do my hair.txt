Jenny McCarthy: I feel transgender inside, and I hope my son’s gay so he can do my hair

Former Playboy Bunny Jenny McCarthy has claimed she feels transgender because she’s “like one of the guys”.

The model, actress and former TV host was asked about her role as transgender woman Brandi in 90s TV series ‘Just Shoot Me’.

She told PrideSource: “I feel like that inside. I always felt like one of the guys wearing, like, a Playboy bunny outfit.

“I was David Spade’s buddy to begin with, so I was a natural fit, and I always felt like his brother.

“To play kind of the dude was almost too scary natural.”

When asked how she would feel if her son came out as gay, she said: “Oh my god, I would be so excited. We can shop! Do my hair!”

She added: “I really do feel like, with sexuality being more open and people coming out, there might be a little bi in everybody; it’s just a matter of who acts on it.”

The actress attracted scorn earlier this year when she tweeted the joke: “Did Jennifer Lopez’s boyfriend cheat with a transsexual model? I heard JLo gave him an ultimatum: ‘it’s either me or her/him!'”

Mara Keisling of the National Center for Transgendrer Equality told the Huffington Post: “McCarthy’s comments made about playing Brandi aren’t the worst thing she has said about trans people.

“There are other things in the Pride Source interview that makes me wonder whether Jenny is trying to understand what it’s like to be a trans or queer person today.

“Her claim that ‘there might be a little bi in everybody,’ her misunderstanding about what it means to be a feminist, and the tropes about shopping with her son should he come out as gay — all of that really makes me ask myself whether McCarthy has a true read on who we are and what’s important to us.”
