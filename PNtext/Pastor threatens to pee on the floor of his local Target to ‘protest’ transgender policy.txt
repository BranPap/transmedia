Pastor threatens to pee on the floor of his local Target to ‘protest’ transgender policy

A hardline evangelical radio host has threatened to pee on the floor of his local Target because they let transgender people use the women’s bathrooms.

Rick Wiles, a self-proclaimed “citizen reporter” and host of ‘TruNews’, made the claims while ranting about Target’s transgender bathroom policy – which allows people to use the bathroom of their preferred gender.

Snyder read a statement from Target spokesperson Molly Snyder, who said: “As a company that firmly stands behind what it means to offer our team an inclusive place to work — and our guests an inclusive place to shop — we continue to believe that this is the right thing for Target.”

The statement pointed out that single-stall bathrooms were available, but Mr Wiles added: “How about I just urinate on your floor? How about that Molly? Because you’re defecating on this nation.”

He warned: “It’s either shut down Target or their type is going to shut down this nation, because there’s no end to their insanity and their immorality and their wickedness.”

Elsewhere, Wiles predicted that nuclear war will break out over transgender people using the women’s bathrooms.

He said: “Listen, these freaks are going to get us all killed. They’re going to get us all killed.”

Referencing increased tensions with Russia and the country’s increased military drills, he said: “God is going to use the Russians to bring down Sodom and Gomorrah if there’s no repentance in this land.

“We’re all going to die in a nuclear war thanks to the sodomites that are in control of this nation right now.”


A hoax Facebook post claiming that Target is putting urinals in the women’s toilets has attracted tens of thousands of shares – despite being comprehensively debunked.
