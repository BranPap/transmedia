Fox News apologises for transgender comments

Fox News came under fire last week due to comments made by America’s Newsroom host Gregg Jarrett regarding a transgender contestant on America’s Top Model.

On 14th August, Gregg Jarrett and US Weekly editor-at-Large Ian Drew discussed the transgender contestant, Isis.

The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) claimed that the terminology and tone of the discussion were offensive to transgender people, calling the programme “crude and obnoxious”.

GLAAD claimed that Jarrett mocked Isis’ description of herself as a woman “whose cards were dealt differently”, and took issue with Drew’s reference to the programme as “America’s Next Top Tranny”.

The organisation also pointed out that throughout the discussion, Jarrett switched between male and female pronouns when referring to Isis.

GLAAD contacted Fox News Channel and US Weekly immediately after the show, calling on both to apologise.

The following day Jarrett apologised on air for his comments, saying:

“This time yesterday we aired a segment about a transgender by the name of Isis, who will compete in the upcoming season of the television show America’s Next Top Model.

“The group GLAAD, Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation sent us an email saying it was offensive.

“That was not our intention. We apologize.”

US Weekly also gave an apology, issuing a statement that said:

“We apologize if any group was offended by our editor’s comments as it was by no means his intention.”
