“That (the criticism) didn’t stop me from competing. That didn’t stop me from being who I was.

“It sure as hell didn’t stop me from doing what I wanted to do in the past, and it won’t stop me from what I want to do in the future,” Beggs said.

His mother, Angela McNew, added: “He has so much respect for all the girls he wrestles.

“People think Mack has been beating up on girls … The girls he wrestles with, they are tough.

“It has more to do with skill and discipline than strength.”
