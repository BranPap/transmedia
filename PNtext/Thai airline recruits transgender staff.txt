Thai airline recruits transgender staff

Thai airline PC Air is recruiting transgender staff in a bid to boost the prospects of the “third sex”.

The newly-formed company took on three trans women this week in its first round of hiring.

PC Air boss Peter Chan told the Daily Telegraph: “I think these people can have many careers – not just in the entertainment business – and many of them have a dream to be an air hostess.

“I just made their dream come true. Our society has changed. It’s evolution. I’m a pioneer and I’m sure there will be other organisations following my idea.”

One of the winning candidates was Thanyarat “Film” Jiraphatpakorn, 23, a former winner of the Miss Tiffancy beauty pageant. She said she was delighted about her new job.

The trans staff will wear special badges to identify them to passengers.

Thailand is one of the more tolerant countries towards the wide spectrum of transgenderism.

Transgender women are often referred to as “the third sex”, or as “katoeys”, which is sometimes seen as a pejorative term.

A number of celebrities are transgender, while some schools have installed special “third sex” bathrooms after finding that a large proportion of students want them.
