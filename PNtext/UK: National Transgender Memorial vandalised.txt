UK: National Transgender Memorial vandalised

A memorial to remember victims of transphobic hate crime has been vandalised in Manchester.

The National Transgender Memorial, located in the city’s Sackville Gardens, was unveiled as part of the Sparkle weekend, a national transgender celebration, last month.

Dedicated volunteers had put hours of work into the garden, which is believed to be the only memorial to victims of transphobic hate crime in the world.

Speaking to Gaydio, co-ordinator of the garden project Tony Cooper, said: “The memorial was vandalised at some point yesterday evening. Police have now opened an investigation. Unfortunately there is no CCTV in the area but after this I will be personally campaigning for cameras in the park.”

If anyone has any information, they are being urged to contact Greater Manchester Police on 101 or Crimestoppers 0800 555 111.
