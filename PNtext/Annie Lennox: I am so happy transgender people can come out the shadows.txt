Annie Lennox: I am so happy transgender people can come out the shadows

Annie Lennox has hailed growing acceptance of transgender people, allowing them to come out of  the shadows.

The iconic Scottish singer, 59, made the comments in an interview with the Huffington Post.

She said: “We’re coming to a place where [feminism] needs to be inclusive.

“I think the LGBTQ community are a part of that movement and we’re all sort of connected on this particular level and it’s very exciting – watch that space.”

She added: “I am so happy to see now that transgender women and men are able to come out of the shadows finally and say ‘Look we’re here. Why do we need to pretend we don’t exist?’

“It’s a very interesting time.”

In addition to singing, Lennox is a prominent HIV campaigner, and is an advisor on HIV to the Mayor of London Boris Johnson.

She recently said that the word ‘gay’ had become obsolete, commenting: “This is something I’ve been saying to a lot of my gay compadres: One day we’ll get rid of this word ‘gay,’ because it’s irrelevant.

“Of course it’s terribly relevant when you are trying to create a campaign.

“During a human rights movement, it’s terribly important to have labels and to have platforms that are very identifiable, but ultimately we should just be fine with everybody no matter what our sexual orientation is.

“It’s nobody’s effing business.”

Last year, Annie Lennox commented on the stigma surrounding HIV, calling it one of the “biggest challenges” for people facing the diagnosis and treatment.
