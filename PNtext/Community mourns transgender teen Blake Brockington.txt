Community mourns transgender teen Blake Brockington

A prominent teenage transgender activist has died in an apparent suicide.

18-year-old Blake Brockington from Charlotte, North Carolina, made the news last year when he became the first transgender student to be crowned as his high school’s homecoming king.

Mr Brockington passed away on Monday, according to local LGBT news website QNotes.

Local LGBT Youth Group Time Out Youth wrote on Facebook: “Time Out Youth is saddened by the loss of Blake Brockington.

“The center is open now and we invite youth and volunteers to join us in supporting each other today.

“Please keep Blake’s friends and family in your thoughts today.”

The death comes after a string of prominent suicides of young transgender people, following the death of 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn in December.

Blake Brockington was crowned homecoming king in February 2014 after raising over $2300 (£1400) for charity.

He said at the time: “This means a lot to me… for me this a dream that has finally been made, and for others this is an inspiration.

“I hope this makes everybody know that they can be themselves regardless of what anybody else says. You can do anything you set your mind to.”

However, he later lamented the opposition he had faced, telling the Charlotte Observer: “That was single-handedly the hardest part of my trans journey.

“Really hateful things were said on the Internet. It was hard. I saw how narrow-minded the world really is.”

He had added: “My family feels like this is a decision I made.

“They think, ‘You’re already black, why would you want to draw more attention to yourself?’

“But it’s not a decision. It is who I am. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.”
