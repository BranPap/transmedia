Russia bans transgender people from driving

Russia has enacted new rules banning transgender people from obtaining driver’s licenses.

New regulations enacted by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev ban people with ‘sex disorders’ from driving, as the government claims that they are more likely to crash.

The ban applies to anyone deemed to have a “gender identity disorder” – including “transsexualism” and “dual-role transvestism”.

Other “disorders of sexual preference” also merit a ban – including exhibitionism, sadomasochism and paedophilia – which could also be used to target gay men.

Shockingly, the Professional Drivers Union backed the ban.

Union boss Alexander Kotov said: “We have too many deaths on the road, and I believe toughening medical requirements for applicants is fully justified.”

However, critics say the ban is another way for Putin’s regime to clamp down on the rights of groups deemed taboo.

The Association of Russian Lawyers for Human Rights attacked the “discriminatory” law, and says it will fight for a review from the Russian Constitutional Court.

A statement said: “[The decree] demonstrates bias against certain individuals and groups of citizens, as well as significantly restricting the rights and freedoms of citizens as a whole.”

Jean Freedberg of Human Rights Campaign Global adds: “Restricting transgender people from obtaining drivers licenses is simply another example of the Russian government’s increased campaign of persecution and discrimination against its LGBT population.”
