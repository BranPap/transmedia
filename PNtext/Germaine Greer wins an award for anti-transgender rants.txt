Germaine Greer wins an award for anti-transgender rants

Germaine Greer has won an award for ranting about transgender people.

The noted feminist author has long been outspoken about her beliefs on transgender people, who she claims are de-constructing the meaning of womanhood.

Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire Show, she ranted: “Just because you lop off your d**k and then wear a dress doesn’t make you a f***ing woman.



“I’ve asked my doctor to give me long ears and liver spots and I’m going to wear a brown coat but that doesn’t turn me into a f***ing cocker spaniel.

“A man who gets his d**k chopped off is actually inflicting an extraordinary act of violence on himself.”

Despite outrage at the comments, the 77-year-old picked up the ‘Iconoclast’ prize at the Oldie of the Year awards

According to the Independent, she said at the ceremony: “I feel I have nicked this award. I don’t want to be recognised for being a reactionary. I’m not. I don’t want to recognise polarised gender. We are none of us masculine enough, none of us feminine enough. It’s a losing battle.

“The most fuss and bother wasn’t for anything I said and did recently, rather it’s to do with what I wrote years ago. It was important to me that women understood femininity as a pose, a posture, a cultural artefact.

“I was talking about this fraud of femininity that women are persuaded to accept. I never actually bought into the fight. I was co-opted into the fight.”

Despite claiming she wasn’t trying to “polarise” views, Greer has spoken out about the issue no fewer than six times.
