Transgender drug dealer spared prison

A transgender drug dealer was spared prison after a judge said placing her in a men’s facility would prolong her “sexual nightmare”.

Jean Morris, 41, was convicted of possessing Class C drug ketamine with intent to supply.

At Bristol crown court, Judge Mark Horton said that going to prison would damage Morris’ transition to become a woman but warned her she would be jailed if convicted of any more offences.

According to the Bristol Evening Post, Judge Horton told her: “The reality is this is your final chance to change difficult areas of your sexuality.

“You have received government funding and if I send you to prison I would be sentencing you to a continuation of your sexual nightmare, possibly forever.”

In defence, Anna Vigars said her client’s life had been dominated by her gender difficulties and that she is to begin medical treatment at Charing Cross Hospital’s gender clinic next week.

Morris was handed an 11-month jail term suspended for two years and must also observe a nightly curfew for six months.
