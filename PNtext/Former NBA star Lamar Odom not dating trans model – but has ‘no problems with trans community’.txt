Former NBA star Lamar Odom not dating trans model – but has ‘no problems with trans community’

Former NBA player Lamar Odom is not dating a trans model and actress, according to sources close to the star.

Lamar Odom, who was married to Khloé Kardashian from 2009 to 2016, has been linked to a trans actress and model Daniiellè Alexis.

Social media speculation of the two dating came following Alexis posting photos of herself with Odom.

But dating rumours have now been put to rest following Odom, who is currently single, saying they’re just friends.

Sources close to the two-time NBA Champion told TMZ the pair know each other and are friendly, adding Odom has “no problems with the transgender community”. 

Rumours emerged recently when Alexis shared a photo of her and Odom to her Instagram on Thursday (22 September).

According to TMZ the pair met back in June when Odom was in LA for the BET Awards which celebrate Black culture across multiple media forms.

Its sources claim Odom was shopping when a car pulled up and Alexis jumped out to ask for a photo. 

TMZ’s sources say the duo tend to speak about the film industry as Alexis is an aspiring actress. 

The sources also said he has “no issue with Alexis being a transgender woman”, but “there’s simply no romantic spark between them”.
