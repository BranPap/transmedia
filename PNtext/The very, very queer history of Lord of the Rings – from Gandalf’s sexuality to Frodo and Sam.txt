The very, very queer history of Lord of the Rings – from Gandalf’s sexuality to Frodo and Sam

As one of the most influential fantasy texts of the 20th century, literary analysis has dug deep and found rich LGBTQ+ representation and metaphor.

The 20 minute talk, available to watch on YouTube, is led by non-binary professor Cordeliah Lodgson, who discusses the theme of the transition of Gondor, one of the main ruling Kingdoms in Middle Earth, and its use as an analogy to transgenderism.

The talk touches on characters such as Éowyn (discussed later) and her defiance of the gender binary, along with Faramir and Denethor, and their place in the books’ queer undercurrents.

Within the series there are several queer-coded relationships that have gained huge traction in the LGBTQ+ community – not least that between Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee.

When McKellen filmed the movies he was the only openly gay cast member – but over the past two decades more of the actors have come out including The Hobbit stars Lee Pace (Elven King Thranduil) and Luke Evans (Bard the Bowman).
