Against Me! singer debuts transgender documentary series

Against Me! singer Laura Jane Grace has launched an online web documentary about her transition to female.

Punk rock frontwoman Laura Jane Grace came out as transgender in 2012, and has continued to enjoy some success with the band.

The band released an album titled Transgender Dysphoria Blues in January, peaking at number 23 on the US Billboard album chart.

A documentary series exploring Grace’s transition – titled True Trans – today aired its first four episodes on AOL.

Laura Jane Grace said: “The opportunity I had while shooting this show was nothing short of tremendous.

“Getting the chance to listen to other people tell their stories of how life shaped their identities and views on gender couldn’t help but further inform my own understanding of just how complicated and also how simple all of it really is.”

The synopsis states: “No stranger to being different, Laura Jane Grace always felt like an outsider in the posh Florida suburb where she grew up.

“It was only in the rebellion of the punk scene and playing music that she found a home.

“After surviving years of struggle, things finally seemed to be taking off when her band inked its first major record deal. On the inside, though, Laura was buckling under the pressure of being someone she wasn’t.”

The show’s first four episodes are available here.
