Caitlyn Jenner raised $1.3 million for transgender organisations with MAC Cosmetics

Caitlyn Jenner has raised $1.3 million for trans organisations this year through her partnership with MAC Cosmetics.

MAC posted the announcement to Instagram on Friday which was Jenner’s birthday.



They wrote on Instagram: “Happy birthday to our friend and collaborator Caitlyn Jenner! We are so proud of the impact made by her Finally Free lipstick for the MAC Transgender Initiative!

“All $1.3 million is going towards trans organisations around the United States like Glaad, LGBT Centre NYC and LA LGBT Centre to enhance access to healthcare, economic empowerment and civil rights.” 

Jenner and MAC announced their partnership in February with the release of ‘Finally Free’, a rose shade lipstick. 

The colour was designed to be for “all ages, all races and all sexes.” 

Jenner wanted to make an everyday shade, so as more of the product would sell. 

“I wanted a lipstick that would be universal, suited to more people, and was an everyday lipstick, not just a high-glam, once-in-a-while kind of lipstick,” the 67-year-old said of the shade.

100% of the selling price has gone towards MAC’s AIDS Fun Transgender Initiative and there have been over 75,000 sales of the product since it’s release in April. 

“Transgender people have had unprecedented visibility in the last few years, but it hasn’t always benefitted trans people, particularly those most in need,” Jenner said.

“With Mac, I’ve found a partner that demonstrates a real commitment to the funding of transgender specific organisations and projects. I’ve been granted an extraordinary platform, one built upon the work of countless, and too often nameless, trans people who came before me.”

The trans former Olympian went head to head with daughter Kylie in the makeup world when she launched the lipstick. 

She joined the ranks of people who have been given their own colour by MAC, including Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj and Rihanna.
