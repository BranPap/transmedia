Rose McGowan claims there’s a conspiracy to discredit her after hurling abuse at transgender woman

Rose McGowan has claimed that an incident in which she shouted transphobic comments is a conspiracy to discredit her, claiming the transgender woman she clashed with is a “paid actor” and a “monster”.

The Charmed actress had become a vocal activist calling out sexual harassment in Hollywood, but her increasingly erratic comments have led to a rift between her and the Time’s Up movement.

McGowan abruptly cancelled a book tour over the weekend – after a video was posted online of her shouting expletives at a transgender activist.

The transgender woman had attempted to get McGowan to speak about her previous negative comments about trans women. But the confrontation quickly grew hostile as McGowan told her to “f**k off” before taking exception to being referred to as “cisgender” – meaning non-transgender.

Rose McGowan shouted: “Don’t label me, sister. Don’t put your labels on me. Don’t you f**king do that. Do not put your labels on me. I don’t come from your planet. Leave me alone. I do not subscribe to your rules. I do not subscribe to your language.

“You will not put labels on me or anybody. Step the f*k back. What I do for the f**king world and you should be f**king grateful. Shut the f**k up. Get off my back. What have you done? I know what I’ve done, God damn it.”

“Don’t label me, sister Don’t put your labels on me. Don’t you f***ing do that. Do not put your labels on me.

“I’m not crying; I’m f***ing mad with the lies. I’m mad that you put s*** on me because I have a f***ing vagina and I’m white or I’m black or I’m yellow or I’m purple. F**k off! All of us want to say it”

The actress has since taken to Twitter to claim that  the whole incident was a conspiracy and that the person who confronted her was a “paid actor”





She said: “I am cancelling upcoming public appearances because I have given enough. I have given beauty, in return I was VERBALLY ASSAULTED for two full minutes @BNBuzz by an actor paid to verbally assault a woman who has been terrorized by your system. And no ONE in that room did anything”.

McGowan then shared a message reportedly identifying the transgender woman who she had clashed with.

She wrote: “The Cult of Complicity- those I call out are after me. This is the monster who was paid to violate me publicly. An aggressive two minutes long assault on a long abused woman who is simply trying to change the world and make it better.”

Despite a video of the incident being shared widely online, McGowan also questioned how journalists had got a “transcript” of the clash to cover the incident.

Responding to Variety, she wrote: “Look who got the transcript word for word! Why it’s the longtime mouthpiece for the Pig Monster, @Variety You don’t sayyyyyyyyy ! Coincidence that Peter Bart & other journalists paid to smear me and others victims all these years, are still aiding and abetting? No.”

When Huffington Post covered the incident, she said: “Like pearls before swine like you”.



She then suggested that everyone around her was “complicit”.

The actress said: “Everyone from my publicists, to assistants, managers and every person sitting in their chairs frozen by their weakness, a weakness called COMPLICITY. The truth is you all failed me. Again. And again. And again.”

McGowan also went on to condemn Barnes and Noble, where she was hosting her book signing.

She said: “I would like an apology from the manager of the Union Square @BNUnionSquareNY and all security people, and the audience, who did nothing and let the paid verbal assault of an assaulted woman happen. Cool?”

The transgender woman had been attempting to get McGowan to address comments she made on a podcast last year about trans women.

McGowan had said: “That’s not growing as a woman, that’s not living in this world as a woman, and a lot of the stuff I hear trans [women] complaining about, yeah, welcome to the world.”

The actress has a history of erratic and anti-LGBT comments.

In 2014, she claimed that gay people “fought for the right to stand on top of a float wearing an orange speedo” taking MDMA.

She said: “gay men are as misogynistic as straight men, if not more so. I have an indictment of the gay community right now, I’m actually really upset with them.”

She also held a defiant party in support of the Brunei-owned Beverly Hills Hotel, despite it being boycotted by a host of other celebrities because of the country’s anti-gay stoning laws

McGowan has previously hit out at Caitlyn Jenner, claiming she has “male privilege” and “doesn’t understand” being female.
