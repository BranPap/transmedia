Man found guilty in retrial over transgender woman’s murder

A London man has been found guilty for a second time of murdering a transgender woman.

Leon Fyle, of Catford, was convicted of the murder of Destiny Lauren last September and sentenced to 21 years in prison.

Earlier this year, the Court of Appeal ruled his original conviction was “unsafe”.

A retrial was held over the last four weeks at Southwark Crown Court.

Ms Lauren, 29, Of Kentish Town, began living as a woman at the age of 17 and worked as a prostitute.

The court heard Fyle, 23, contacted her through a newspaper advert on November 5th 2009.

He had sex with her before strangling her with her tights.

While in her flat, he also stole £350 in cash, her mobile phone and jewellery before going to Kings Cross to have sex with two more prostitutes.

A sentence was due to be given today.
