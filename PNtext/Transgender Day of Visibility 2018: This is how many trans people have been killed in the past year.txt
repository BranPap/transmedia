Transgender Day of Visibility 2018: This is how many trans people have been killed in the past year

Every year, on International Transgender Day of Visibility, it’s important to celebrate the successes, progress and achievements of trans people and trans rights.

But it’s also important to look at the setbacks and tragedies that have lined the way, to show how much progress still needs to be made, and how important that work is.

In that spirit, PinkNews is looking at how many trans people have been killed since the last TDoV.

Since March 31 last year, at least 190 trans people have been murdered.

This number, though it was put together with help from the Trans Murder Monitoring Project and the Transgender Day of Remembrance, is still almost certainly a conservative estimate, as reporting is imperfect in this area.

Even in the US, many trans victims are still misgendered by police, especially in their initial reports.

And sure, numbers are just numbers. But they also help to build a picture of the global state of affairs when it comes to trans people.

And though any amount of murders is bad, the fact that – on average – one trans person has been murdered every two days is horrific.

The world is still a dangerous place for trans people.

In October, the chief executive of Stonewall, Ruth Hunt, said that the UK was an “unsafe, unwelcoming and frightening place for trans people”.

One trans person has been killed here over the past 12 months. If the UK is unsafe, what does that make the US, where 15 trans people were murdered? Or Mexico, which has seen at least 33 trans deaths?

These numbers should emphasise the necessity of continuing the fight to make trans people equal in the eyes of the law.
