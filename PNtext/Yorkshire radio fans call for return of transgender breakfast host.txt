Yorkshire radio fans call for return of transgender breakfast host

A campaign has been set up to return former Capital FM host Stephanie Hirst to the airwaves, after she came out as transgender.

Stephanie Hirst, 39 – previously known as Simon Hirst – hosted a popular breakfast show on Capital FM Yorkshire, but abruptly left the station in June.

She came out as transgender last week, telling BBC Five Live: “There were many times on the air in recent years where I nearly said that I’m transgender.

“I knew from around the same time that I knew I wanted to be on the radio that something wasn’t right.

“I didn’t feel complete, I didn’t feel like it locked. I felt like a square peg in a round hole but I didn’t know why and I couldn’t work it out.”

So far over 22,000 people have joined a Facebook page to see her show reinstated, titled ‘We Want Stephanie Hirst Back On Capital FM’.

The group said: “This page was created because we want Stephanie back on the radio… but only when she is ready.

“I hope that one day (sooner rather than later) she will return to what she should be doing – being the bloody best radio presenter Yorkshire has!”

Stephanie added: “Thank you everyone for all your support.

“I’m sat here reading every message of support. Please, if you feel like you desperately NEED to change something in your life, and you have a fear of doing so….DO IT! My transition has proved that anything is possible to us all. xxxxxxxxxx”

Former Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles – who was named Stonewall Bully of the Year in 2006 – voiced his support for Ms Hirst last week, tweeting : “140 characters is just not enough to explain how proud I am of my dear friend Stephanie Hirst and the life she will now lead. It’s all good!”.
