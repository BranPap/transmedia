New film about transgender prostitutes was filmed entirely on iPhones

A new film has screened that tells the story of two transgender prostitutes – and it was filmed entirely on iPhones.

Sean Baker’s Tangerine, which debuted to a positive reception at Sundance Film Festival this week, features transgender actresses Kitana Kiki Rodriguez and Mya Taylor as two sex workers searching for their pimp on Christmas eve.

The film – which is the first major acting role for Ms Taylor – also has a unique selling point, having been filmed entirely using the iPhone 5S.

Baker told the New York Times: “It made it more cinematic and we used this great app called Filmic Pro.

“And all of these combined really I think really gave us a really unique, really different look and that’s something that we were trying to achieve with this film, because also the subject matter is kind of different.”

Taylor added: “I’m very happy about what’s going on with transgender people coming out into the screen, because it’s unheard of, you know?”

Worldwide distribution rights for the film were scooped up by Magnolia Pictures, following the airing at Sundance.

A statement from Baker said: “The ‘Tangerine’ team is overjoyed to find a home at Magnolia Pictures and are humbled to be a part of their roster of prestigious, bold and forward-thinking films

“I’m personally thrilled that Magnolia recognizes the theatrical potential of ‘Tangerine.’ Audiences will have the chance to see it on the big screen, the way it was intended to be experienced.”

Eamonn Bowles of Magnolia said: “It’s got as many laugh-out-loud moments as any film I’ve seen in years, along with heart and empathy. Sean Baker is an incredibly talented filmmaker, and the ensemble cast is a revelation.”

Despite its coincidental naming, the film is unrelated to new British LGBT-themed shows Cucumber, Banana and Tofu.
