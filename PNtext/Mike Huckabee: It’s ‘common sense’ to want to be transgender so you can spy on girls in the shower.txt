Mike Huckabee: It’s ‘common sense’ to want to be transgender so you can spy on girls in the shower

Republican Presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee has refused to retract a joke, after claiming he wants to be transgender so he could ogle teenage girls in the shower.

Mr Huckabee, who is one of nine Republicans who have officially declared they will run for President, initially made the much-ridiculed joke at the National Religious Broadcasters Convention.

Ranting about anti-discrimination laws in a number of cities that outlaw discrimination based on gender identity, he joked about being transgender himself.

He said: “We are now in city after city watching ordinances say that your seven-year-old daughter, if she goes into the restroom, cannot be offended and you can’t be offended if she’s greeted there by a 42-year-old man who feels more like a woman than he does a man.

“Now I wish that someone told me that when I was in high school that I could have felt like a woman when it came time to take showers in PE.

“I’m pretty sure that I would have found my feminine side and said, ‘Coach, I think I’d rather shower with the girls today’.”

Despite a backlash even from his fellow Republican candidates, Mr Huckabee has refused to retract the creepy joke – insisting it is “common sense”.

Right Wing Watch reports he told Iowa talk radio host Steve Deace: “I take nothing back from that speech.

“I’m kind of glad it’s posted because people, if they watch the whole clip, what they’re going to see is that I’m giving a commonsense answer to the insanity that’s going on out there.

“Because I hear people, everybody wants to be politically correct, everybody wants to be loved by the media and loved by the left and loved by the elitists.

“But, you know, I know I’m not going to be, so let’s just get it over with. I’d rather be a commonsense candidate for people who did take their brains to work today.”
