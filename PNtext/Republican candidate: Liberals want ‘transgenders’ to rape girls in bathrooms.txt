Republican candidate: Liberals want ‘transgenders’ to rape girls in bathrooms

A Republican state candidate in Colorado has claimed that “liberals demand public access to rape your girls” by allowing “transgenders” to use female toilets.

Gordon Klingenschmitt, who is currently running in a two-way Repubican primary for Colorado’s House District 15, made the comments to subscribers to his mailing list.

According to Right Wing Watch, he wrote: “‘Transgenders’ want your children. Liberals demand public access to rape your girls, at least visually in public bathrooms, or to expose themselves to your girls at school, without parental consent or protection of any kind. Maine parents should immediately remove their children from public schools, and teach them at home.

“For-profit business owners have NO religious exemptions, which will force Christians to choose: either quit your business or hire gays who may directly oppose the mission of your corporation. Owners of Bible publishers, Christian bookstores, Chick-Fil-A and Hobby Lobby will no longer be permitted to operate a business that honours God and fulfils their owner’s mission to promote godliness in the marketplace.”

Earlier this year a Maine court has ruled that it was a violation of an 11-year-old trans girl’s human rights for her school to prevent her from using the female bathroom.

Klingenschmitt, a disgraced former Navy chaplain, has previously made a string of anti-gay comments, claiming earlier this year that gay soldiers cause problems in the military by “taking breaks on the combat field to change diapers”, because their “treacherous sin” means they “lose control of their bowels”.

Last August, he said: “If your heart is full of corruption or sin or immorality – in this case, homosexuality – then you should be discriminated against.”
