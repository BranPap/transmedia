MEPs welcome first EU-wide gay and transgender experience survey

Members of the European Parliament have welcomed the EU Fundamental Rights Agency’s first Europe-wide survey of the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.

The data will also help two other key EU institutions, the European Commission and the Council of the European Union, to make relevant legislative proposals in the future.

Michael Cashman MEP, Co-president of the European Parliament’s Intergroup on LGBT Rights, said: “The Fundamental Rights Agency has always done highly relevant work in the field of fundamental rights and non-discrimination, and I’m pleased they’ve taken on this important project.

Ulrike Lunacek MEP, Co-president of the LGBT Intergroup, added: “The lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are seldom accurately represented in mainstream policy debates.
