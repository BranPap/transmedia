Does Jurassic World feature a transgender dinosaur?

People are complaining about a “transgender” dinosaur in Jurassic World – after the toy version of a female dinosaur was identified as male.

In the film, Chris Pratt’s character was a Velociraptor trainer who worked with a pack of female dinosaurs, including the vicious Blue.

However, despite being consistently referred to female in the film, merchandising refers to Blue as a male dinosaur – leading to the confusion among fans.

A Blue figurine released by Hasbro claims: “This awesome figure looks just like velociraptor Blue! He’s ready to team up with his fellow Velociraptors to hunt the ultimate predator.

“His slashing claws and growling attack will destroy anything in the way. Let the hunt begin with your Velociraptor Blue figure.”

The gender-flipping has upset fans of the film – and while many make serious points about the lack of female-identified toys, some have complained about the “sex-swap dinosaur”, the Metro notes.

The film’s star Chris Pratt previously claimed that society needs to objectify men more to ‘balance out’ sexism.

He said: “A huge part of the way my career’s shifted is based on the way that I look, the way that I’ve shaped my body to look.

“I think it’s okay… I don’t feel appalled by it. I think it’s appalling that for a long time only women were objectified, but I think if we really want to advocate for equality, it’s important to not objectify women less, but objectify men just as often as we objectify women.

“There are a lot of beautiful women who got careers out of it, and I’m using it to my advantage.

“At the end of the day, our bodies are objects. We’re just big bags of flesh and blood and meat and organs that God gives us to drive around.”
