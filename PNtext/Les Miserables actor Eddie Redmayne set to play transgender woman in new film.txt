Les Miserables actor Eddie Redmayne set to play transgender woman in new film

British actor Eddie Redmayne is to play a transgender woman in an adaptation of critically acclaimed novel The Danish Girl.

The movie will be based on David Ebershoff’s 2001 book depicting a true love story between Einar Wegener and his wife, Gerda, and will be directed by Les Miserables director Tom Hooper.

Wegener, a painter from Denmark was born intersex and became one of the first people to undergo gender reassignment surgery, officially becoming Lili Elbe in 1930.

Hooper told the Hollywood Reporter: “‘The Danish Girl’ is an extraordinary love story about finding your true self.

“I was so moved by this true story; I have wanted to make the film ever since (reading the book)”, He added.

This will be the pairs first collaboration since working together on the Oscar winning film adaptation of Les Miserables two years earlier.

The project has suffered several drawbacks during its adaptation, with Nicole Kidman, Charlize Theron, Gywneth Paltrow and Rachel Weisz all considered for the lead role previously.
