Teen arrested for killing black transgender woman in Miami

Police say they have arrested a male teenager who allegedly admitted to shooting a transgender woman to death in Miami, Florida, last week.

Kiki Fantroy, 21, was fatally shot on 31 July, marking the 13th known murder of a black trans woman in the US this year.

Officers said a 17-year-old was arrested on Monday (5 August) for an unrelated case before admitting to shooting Fantroy.

She was returning from a party and was propositioned for sex by the teen, according to NBC. Miami-Dade Police said he chased her and opened fire after she rejected him.

Fantroy was taken to a nearby hospital where she died of her injuries. A vigil was held for the victim on Thursday night.

Her mother, Rhonda Comer, remembered her daughter as having “a heart of gold” and being “a very loving person.”

She told the Miami Herald: “This feeling is indescribable. The pain. The void. You know that feeling after losing a child and you losing a child for no apparent reason. Because she’s gay.

“And my understanding, you know, my understanding was she was killed because of her desire to be a woman.”

Fantroy, who loved photography and music, came out as transgender ten years ago while in school.

Fantroy’s death is the 13th known case of deadly violence against the transgender community in 2019. All of the victims were black transgender women.

The names of the other women are Dana Martin, Jazzaline Ware, Ashanti Carmon, Claire Legato, Muhlaysia Booker, Michelle Washington, Paris Cameron, Chynal Lindsey, Chanel Scurlock, Zoe Spears, Brooklyn Lindsey and Denali Berries Stuckey.
