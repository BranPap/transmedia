Chloe Sevigny to play transgender assassin in British series

Actress Chloe Sevigny will play a transgender assassin in a new British mini-series.

Hit And Miss will begin filming this summer and tells the story of a trans hitwoman who discovers she fathered children before transitioning.

Sevigny told Blackbook: “It’s a British production for Sky Atlantic, and I’m playing a pre-op male-to-female tranny assassin. 

“It’s very realistic. It’s being created by a lot of the people who were involved in the original Skins, so it’s going to be very edgy.” 

In 1999, Sevigny appeared in Boys Don’t Cry, the story of trans man Brandon Teena, who was raped and murdered.

She won an Oscar nomination for playing his girlfriend, while Hillary Swank took the lead role.
