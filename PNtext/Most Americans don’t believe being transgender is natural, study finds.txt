Most Americans don’t believe being transgender is natural, study finds

A startling new survey has revealed the social attitudes of Americans to transgender rights.

The polling by the Williams Institute and Ipsos surveyed people in 23 countries about their attitudes, including in the US.

Less than half of American respondents said they believe being transgender is a ‘natural occurrence’.

On the subject matter, ‘Belief that Transgender People are a Natural Occurrence by Country’, the poll’s results suggested many are yet to sign up to trans rights.

20.1% said they strongly agree with the statement, while 24.1% somewhat agreed.

However 21.3% strongly disagreed and 16.6% somewhat disagreed.

17.9% answered ‘don’t know’ when asked if being transgender was a natural occurrence. 

There were positives in the results however.

More than three in four believed trans people should be able to change their gender identity on government documents.

Meanwhile more Americans believed transgender people should be able to the restroom of their choice, rather than be prescribed by legislators. 

The poll comes after North Carolina failed to repeal its discriminatory HB2 bill.

A special session of the legislator was held to repeal HB2, but fell down after negotiations were distorted.

Republican legislators in the state say they still support HB2, and lieutenant Governor Dan Forest urged those who want the law to remain to “continue to stand strong.”

He said: “I support HB2 and do not favor its repeal… No economic, political or ideological pressure can convince me that what is wrong is right. It will always be wrong for men to have access to women’s showers and bathrooms.
