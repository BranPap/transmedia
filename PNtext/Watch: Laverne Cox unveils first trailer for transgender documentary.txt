Watch: Laverne Cox unveils first trailer for transgender documentary


Laverne Cox has unveiled the first trailer for her long-awaited documentary exploring transgender issues.

The Orange is the New Black star has offered a glimpse into her hour-long documentary, a collaboration with MTV which bills itself as a “celebration” of trans people.

She says: “We live in a world where people are often judged for being different, but this is a celebration of those differences – as well as how we’re the same.

“We’ll follow the courageous lives of young trans people, from the moment of realisation to dating, family and the often-dangerous obstacles they faced on the path to self-discovery.”

“For many of us, the ‘T’ in LGBT means more than transgender. It also means truth. The cast members in this documentary are fearlessly living their truths and in sharing their stories will send the message to other trans youth that it’s OK to be who you are.”

Cox – who is also set to appear in the second season of MTV’s lesbian drama Faking It – is the highest profile transgender actress in the US.

She recently made history as the first transgender actress to be nominated for an Emmy award, though she ultimately lost out to Orange is the New Black co-star Uzo Aduba.

Cox was featured on the cover of TIME magazine earlier this year, and was awarded GLAAD’s highest honour, the Stephen F. Kolzak award, for her activism and advocacy work in April.

The T Word is set to broadcast on MTV in the US on  Friday, October 17. A UK broadcast date is yet to be confirmed.
