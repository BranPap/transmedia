YouTuber Charlie McDonnell proudly comes out as trans: ‘New gender just dropped’

She posted for the first time in two years to tell her followers, writing on her Instagram story: “New gender just dropped.”

Her coming out post is a simple selfie, with grown-out hair and a yellow top, alongside the caption: “Still going by Charlie but the new pronouns are she/they!” with the trans and non-binary flag.
