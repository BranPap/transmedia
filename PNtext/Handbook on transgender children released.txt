Handbook on transgender children released

For parents and professionals alike, raising a transgender child can be confusing and challenging.

A new book published in the US tackles the issues “thousands of families face raising children who step outside of the pink or blue box.”

The Transgender Child: A Handbook for Families and Professionals deals with how to decide if a child is trans, family acceptance, the education system and medical and legal issues.

“Providing extensive research and interviews as well as years of experience working in the field, authors Stephanie Brill and Rachel Pepper explore what is currently known and understood about gender,” said the book’s publisher in a press release.

“They describe the process that many families go through after learning that a child is transgender or gender variant and lay out strategies for parents to  move from crisis to acceptance.

“Brill and Pepper cover developmental stages of the transgender child from birth to college, transition decisions, appropriate disclosure, and the educational, medical, and legal issues that parents and therapists need to know.”

Ms Pepper is the Coordinator of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Studies at Yale University and the author of The Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy for Lesbians.

Ms Brill founded Gender Spectrum Education and Training and wrote The Queer Parents Primer and co-authored The New Essential Guide to Lesbian Conception, Pregnancy, and Birth.
