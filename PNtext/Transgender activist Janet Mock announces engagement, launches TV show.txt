Transgender activist Janet Mock announces engagement, launches TV show

Transgender activist Janet Mock – who just landed a new TV show with MSNBC – has also revealed her engagement.

Mock won praise when she turned the tables on an interviewer earlier this year, firing back some of the invasive questions about her genitals that she is regularly asked.

She recently landed a show of her own, this week launching her own show So POPular! on MSNBC’s online – a progressive look at entertainment and pop culture news.

However, the TV host has other big news this week – after receiving a proposal from boyfriend Aaron Tredwell.

She posted a picture of the pair to Instagram, with the caption “I said YES.”

Mock feuded with Piers Morgan in February, after he referred to her in an interview as a ‘former man’ and asked a series of ignorant questions

She said: “He’s trying to do info-tainment. He doesn’t really want to talk about trans issues, he wants to sensationalize my life and not really talk about the work that I do and what the purpose of me writing this book was about.”
