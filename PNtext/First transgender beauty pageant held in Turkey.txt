First transgender beauty pageant held in Turkey

Over 500 spectators attended Turkeyâ€™s first transgender beauty pageant last week.

The beauty pageant was held in Istanbul as part of the weeklong celebration of Pride.

13 competitors took part in the pageant, and eventually Yanki Bayramoglu took home the crown.

Although it is not illegal in Turkey to be gay or transgender, LGBT people still face persecution and violent attacks. 

It is estimated 70 trans people have been killed in Turkey since 2002.

On Sunday, tens of thousands of people turned out on Sunday to celebrate LGBT Pride in Istanbul, slated as the largest gay pride celebration in any majority Muslim country.
