Man arrested in assault on transgender woman in Dallas

Police in Dallas have arrested a 29-year-old man in the beating of a transgender woman in an attack that was captured on camera.

Edward Thomas was arrested at 9.30pm on Sunday for “his role” in the attack, police said.

He was jailed on suspicion of aggravated assault, the Press Association reported.

Police did not say whether anyone else would be arrested in connection with the attack, which took place on Friday.

A clip went viral of the incident which appearing to show a mob violently assaulting 23-year-old Muhlaysia Booker following a traffic incident.

In the disturbing video, a large crowd can be seen gathering as Booker is repeatedly punched and kicked by several men.

At one point Booker attempts to stumble away, but is again set upon by the men, before being dragged along the ground away from the incident.

The woman told police she was attacked after a minor traffic accident.

Booker, who told WFAA that her attackers used anti-LGBT slurs during the incident, was hospitalised with facial fractures and an injury to her right arm.

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said: “Chief Hall alerted me this morning to the assault at the Royal Crest Apartments and I have seen a video of what happened. I am extremely angry about what appears to be mob violence against this woman.



“I am in contact with the chief and she assured me that the Dallas Police Department is fully investigating, including the possibility that this was a hate crime.

“Those who did this do not represent how Dallasites feel about our thriving LGBTQ community. We will not stand for this kind of behaviour.”

In a Facebook post following an outpouring of support, Booker wrote: “I love y’all sooo much.

“Thank you so much it’s a blessing being lucky enough to witness the love and respect I’m getting and thank you to all my genuine friends that been with me through this journey and knowing the real me knowing nobody deserves that.”
