Nevada governor signs transgender protection law

The governor of Nevada has signed a law to protect transgender people from employment discrimination.

Republican governor Brian Sandoval signed the bill into law at a ceremony in Carson City on Tuesday.

The bill means that companies with more than 15 employees cannot discriminate against staff on the basis of their gender identity. They may demand appropriate dress codes and grooming standards for the individual’s preferred gender.

Current Nevada law prevents job discrimination based on a person’s colour, race, sex, religion, age, disability or national origin. 

The bill’s primary sponsor, Las Vegas Assemblyman Paul Aizley, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that Mr Sandoval has also promised to sign two other bills to ban anti-trans discrimination in public accommodation and in housing.

Fourteen states now explicitly ban discrimination against transgender people, while others have partial protection.
