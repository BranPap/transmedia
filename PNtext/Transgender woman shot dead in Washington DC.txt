Transgender woman shot dead in Washington DC

A transgender woman was shot dead in Washington DC on Wednesday morning.

Police said Lashai McLean, 23, was walking along Dix Street in the north-east area with another transgender person when they exchanged words with two men.

Shots were then fired and Ms McLean was hit at least once. She was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

Officers do not yet know if the killing was motivated by transphobia.

Speaking to Associated Press, Ms McLean’s boyfriend Jason Coleman said: “It hurts me terrible. I don’t know what I’m going to do without her.”
