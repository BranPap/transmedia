Today is Transgender Day of Remembrance to remember all killed by transphobic violence

Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR) is taking place today with vigils and memorial events across the UK and around the world.

It’s to remember people who have died as a result of their actual or perceived transgender identity.

TDoR first started in 1998, following the murder of Rita Hester, a transgender African American woman in Massachusetts. International statistics compiled by the Trans Respect Monitoring Project released last week identified 238 trans people murdered across the world in the past 12 months.

However, campaigners warn the true figure is likely to be higher as transphobic crime remains underreported – and not all jurisdictions document or treat the cases accordingly.

The ninth annual remembrance event in London will be held at the University of London Union on Malet Street, Bloomsbury, from 7pm this evening.

The keynote address will be given by Paris Lees, journalist and broadcaster.

Speakers include Roz Kaveney, Jon Gierson and Natacha Kennedy, with music from Yui Karlberg and Naechané Valantino.

Organised by London TransDiversity, the London International Trans Day of Remembrance is a non-political, non-profit event hosted by, and for, trans people. Campaigners say all trans and gender-diverse people, as well as their friends and allies, are welcome to attend.
