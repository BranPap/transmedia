Daniel Radcliffe says it was ‘important’ to defend trans kids after JK Rowling comments

Two years on, with Rowling continuing to spout anti-trans rhetoric, Radcliffe has doubled down on his stance and explained why he spoke out in the first place.

“And so seeing them hurt on that day I was like, I wanted them to know that not everybody in the franchise felt that way. And that was really important.”

Daniel Radcliffe is just such a good guy, just a weird dude living his life and supporting trans people. Great dude https://t.co/Tu7n9bv7a6

We can’t undo the massive amount of damage JK has done, but maybe Daniel Radcliffe can make queer and trans kids who felt betrayed by the author of their favorite series feel accepted again. He has such integrity and I admire him greatly. https://t.co/JRMKNTsfYv

What really strikes me about this quote is, if Daniel Radcliffe met a lot of trans kids who identified with Potter, then JKR definitely did too.
She met them. She heard their stories.
And she still went full TERF. https://t.co/ua02V16d0b

Radcliffe’s comments come just days after Voldemort actor Ralph Fiennes spoke out in support of JK Rowling.
