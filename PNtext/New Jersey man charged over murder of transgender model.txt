New Jersey man charged over murder of transgender model

A New Jersey man has been charged with murder and bias intimidation over the death of a transgender woman last September.

Victoria Carmen White, 28, was shot dead after an altercation on September 12th 2010 at a house in Maplewood.

She had been out with her cousin when they met Alrashim Chambers, 24, and Marquise Foster, 26. The four are said to have returned to the cousin’s apartment.

White was a lingerie model who transitioned nine years ago and prosecutors say Chambers shot her multiple times when he discovered her transgender history.

The two men were arrested in October after a month on the run. In May, Foster pleaded guilty to hindering apprehension.

Chambers, who is being held in Essex County Jail, is also facing two weapons charges.

White was initially identified by police by her former male name, despite changing her birth certificate four years ago.

After the model’s family questioned the error, police attributed the mix-up to a witness account.
