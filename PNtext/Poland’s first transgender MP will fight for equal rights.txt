Poland’s first transgender MP will fight for equal rights

Anna Grodzka, Poland’s first transgender MP, says she will seek equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people.

The 57-year-old, who was elected an MP for Krakow last week, said she would make the Catholic country more accepting.

Speaking to Associated Press, she outlined legal recognition of relationships, employment protections and funding for sex reassignment surgery as her goals.

Homosexuality is legal in Poland but gay couples cannot adopt children and there is no rec ignition of gay marriages or civil unions.

Ms Grodzka, a member of the Paillot Party, is thought to be the world’s only sitting transgender MP.

She did not come first in the poll but as the party’s top candidate for Krakow but won her seat under the proportional representation system.
