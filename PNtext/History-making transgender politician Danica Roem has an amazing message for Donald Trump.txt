History-making transgender politician Danica Roem has an amazing message for Donald Trump

Danica Roem, the first transgender person elected to a state legislature in Virginia, gave an incredible victory speech after beating a politician who wanted to take her rights away.

The journalist and heavy metal vocalist triumphed over Bob Marshall, a 26-year incumbent who proposed legislation that would have restricted which bathrooms trans people could use.

Marshall, who lost by 46% to 54% yesterday, also co-authored the state’s now-defunct constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and refused to debate Roem or refer to her as a woman during the campaign, calling her “him” on campaign flyers.

And speaking to fans at her victory party, Roem had a message for him, for Donald Trump, and for anyone else following their lead in embracing anti-LGBT attitudes.

To huge cheers, she said: “This election has to prove nationwide that discrimination is a disqualifier.

“When you champion inclusion, when you champion equality, when you champion equity and you focus on the issues that unite us, like building up our infrastructure…those are the issues that you have to focus on,” she added.

“I believe in building up our infrastructure instead of tearing down each other. That is fundamental.

“When the negative ads started coming out, attacking transgender kids…we stayed on our message while decrying discrimination.”

Roem told everyone watching: “We can’t get lost in discrimination, we can’t get lost in B.S., we can’t get lost tearing each other down.

“No matter what you look like, where you come from, how you worship, who you love, how you identify – and yeah, how you rock – if you have good public policy ideas, if you’re well-qualified for office, bring those ideas to the table, because this is your America too…and we are stronger together,” Roem told the crowd.

She dedicated her win to everyone who’s been discriminated against.



“To every person who’s ever been singled out, who’s ever been stigmatised, who’s ever been the misfit, who’s ever been the kid in the corner, who’s ever needed someone to stand up for them when they didn’t have a voice of their own because there was no-one else who was with them – this one’s for you.”

It was a night of ceilings being smashed and trans and lesbian candidates taking office in landmark elections.

In Seattle, Jenny Durkan won 61% of the vote to become the first out lesbian mayor in the city’s history.

The former federal prosecutor joined Jackie Biskupski, who holds office in Utah’s Salt Lake City, as the only out lesbian mayors of major US cities.

California, the state where Harvey Milk made history in 1978 by becoming the state’s first openly gay elected official, broke another barrier.

Nearly 40 years after Milk took office, Lisa Middleton became the first openly transgender person elected to political office in the state.

After Palm Springs voted her onto its City Council, Middleton said: “Another glass ceiling has been broken.

“For young people who are transgender all over the United States, they are going to have examples for what they can do,” she told local outlet KMIR.

“It says Palm Springs is going to judge you by the content of your character and by the work you’re able to accomplish,” Middleton added.

Pennsylvania also broke its trans barrier, as Tyler Titus became the first openly trans person to be elected in the state.

The 33-year-old professional counsellor, who is a father of two boys, was elected to the Erie School Board.
