US: Video shows transgender woman attacked in a NYC subway station

An unidentified trans woman was attacked in a New York City subway station recently, and the attack was caught on film.

The video, posted on 10 August, shows a man assaulting an unidentified transgender woman in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

An onlooker filmed the attack, but none of the several bystanders seen in the video physically intervened.

Some onlookers can be heard shouting at the pair, asking them to stop fighting. Others can be heard laughing during the attack.

The unidentified assailant can be heard saying: “That bitch is a man and fucking touched me.”

At one point in the video, the man can be heard saying: “Adam and Even not Adam and Steve, motherfuckers. I ain’t no motherfucking faggot.”

The New York City Anti-Violence Project posted about the incident on Facebook, stating they have reached out to several organisations and offices about the incident.

They have also requested a meeting with the MTA to discuss the attack.

Earlier this month, a woman who challenged a man for using homophobic language in a New York City street was slashed in the face.

The New York Police Department is currently looking for two suspects in connection with an anti-gay attack in the Bronx late last month.

Warning: The content of these videos is extremely violent and graphic.
