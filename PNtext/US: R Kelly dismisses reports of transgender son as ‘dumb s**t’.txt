US: R Kelly dismisses reports of transgender son as ‘dumb s**t’

R Kelly shot down an interviewer who asked him about his transgender son, dismissing it as “dumb s**t”.

Appearing on local radio station WCGI, the singer was asked about 14-year-old Jay Kelly’s decision to come out as transgender this month, when he announced his transition to male on social media.

R Kelly blamed the report on unreliable gossip blogs, despite his son himself confirming he is transgender.

He said: “You don’t really wanna open it up by saying my daughter is becoming my son, because if that were true — don’t even give the blogs that kind of credit. You know what I’m saying? Real talk.

“As far as that’s concerned, always believe what you see — with your own eyes that is.

“Always believe what you see. That’s the best way to go about this business. I’ve heard a lot of things about a lot of people, and it was never true.”

“Even when you see it with your own eyes, you gotta know that there’s a backstory. There’s a background. So that’s why you can’t judge nobody.

“I don’t address that… That’s the thing. Why do you think I’ve been here for 27 years and still relevant? Because I don’t address dumb s**t.”
