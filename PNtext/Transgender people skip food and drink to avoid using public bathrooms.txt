Transgender people skip food and drink to avoid using public bathrooms

Transgender people skip eating and drinking in public to avoid needing the bathroom.

A survey has found that some trans people are so anxious of the issues faced by using public bathrooms that they don’t use them at all.

The survey by National Center for Transgender Equality found that one in three take the measure.

They spoke to 1,500 Americans for the survey, which was based around measures in Texas.

Trans men and women in Texas have no state law protecting LGBT people from employment discrimination.

The survey also found that 73% of transgender youth had experienced mistreatment because of their gender identity.

Nearly half said they’d been physically attacked and 14% leaving a school because of how they were treated.

Texas may soon have its own ‘bathroom bill’ under new proposals.

The bill would stop transgender Texans from using any bathroom which does not correspond to the gender stated on their birth certificate.

A previous similar bill introduced by North Carolina cost the state in business, sporting and music events.
