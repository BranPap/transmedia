US Docu-series commissioned about transgender parenting

A television series has been commissioned by a US network about transgender parenting.

The docu-series ‘My Transparent Life’, has been ordered by ABC Family.

It follows teenager Ben who discovers after his parents divorce that his father comes out as transgender.

“ABC Family is best known for its complex, loving and relatable family programming, and we are so proud to partner with Ryan Seacrest Productions to share Ben’s incredible real-life story,” said ABC Family.

“While Ben’s family situation is unusual, the themes and coming-of-age issues are universal, and we think our viewers will find a real connection to them.”

The series is produced by Ryan Seacrest Productions.

Amazon in October renewed comedy-drama series ‘Transparent’ for a second season.

The series, which launched on Amazon last month, features Jeffrey Tambor as trans woman Maura Pfefferman, and deals with her transition as she comes out to her grown-up children.
