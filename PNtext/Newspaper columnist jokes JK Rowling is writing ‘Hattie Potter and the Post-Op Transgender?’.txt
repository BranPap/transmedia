Newspaper columnist jokes JK Rowling is writing ‘Hattie Potter and the Post-Op Transgender?’

A newspaper columnist has joked that JK Rowling is working on a new book: “Hattie Potter and the Post-Op Transgender?”

Patrick Kidd, writing in the Times diary column made the comments in response to a tweet from JK Rowling that she was struggling to choose a gender for characters in her new book.

She wrote: “All I’ve done so far this week is change three characters’ genders and I still don’t know whether their current genitalia are permanent.”



Then in the Times column, Kidd wrote: “JK Rowling is struggling with her latest book… Will this be Hattie Potter and the Post-Op Transgender?”

The famed Harry Potter author responded to replies to her tweet, talking about her choice of font and styling when she is drafting new material.

After claiming her villainous creation Lord Voldemort is “nowhere near as bad” as Donald Trump, Rowling has now turned her attention to the presidential candidate’s campaign team.

Trump’s spokeswoman Katrina Pierson caused a stir on social media recently after a controversial tweet from 2012 went viral.



“President Obama’s dad born in Africa, Mitt Romney’s dad born in Mexico. Any pure breeds left? #CNNDebate’,” Pierson wrote.

Unsurprisingly, the spokeswoman received a huge backlash from fellow Twitter users – however, Rowling’s response put the rest to shame.

“Death Eaters walk among us,” she wrote, simply.



For those who are unfamiliar with the Harry Potter franchise, Death Eaters is the name given to the twisted followers of Lord Voldemort.

Rowling has become known for giving brilliant responses on social media.

Highlights include a recent response to the Westboro Baptist Church (WBC), who took offence to the idea of Rowling’s creation Dumbledore marrying fellow wizard Gandalf.



She has also used Twitter to support her legion of LGBT fans, offering words of wisdom and comforting advice to those struggling with their sexuality.
