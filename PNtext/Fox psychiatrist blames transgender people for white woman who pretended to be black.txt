Fox psychiatrist blames transgender people for white woman who pretended to be black

Fox News psychiatrist Keith Ablow has blamed transgender people for a white woman who pretended she was black.

Rachel Dolezal, the head of a branch of the NCAAP in Spokane, Washington, was ‘unmasked’ last week as a white woman.

The family of Ms Dolezal revealed she is actually white – despite claiming to be a black woman and working as an Africana Studies professor.

Fox pundit Keith Ablow claimed that transgender people were actually to blame for the ruse.

He said: “I’ve been saying for a long time we could find ourselves at this moment.

“I’m not judging folks who put forward a transgender position, Caitlyn Jenner and the rest, but I did note that when you decide that a genetic reality is not reality, if this woman believes to her core that her identity is that of a black woman, one could argue… that she should be accepted according to her quote racial identity.

“I think we’re heading down an untested path where people’s self-concept is going to dictate the way we have to behave towards them.

He continued: “If I believe in my soul I’m a 65 year old… can I apply for Medicare?

“You might think that’s funny, but I’ve asked more than one attorney who says ‘that’s not funny, given the transgender case law, you may have a point’.”

“Some might claim that Caitlyn Jenner chose her identity, or his depending on the way people see it, in order to get on the cover of magazines because that person’s addicted to fame.

“That’s a very dangerous position to take if you object to lots of threats, which I’ve gotten.

“The Liberal element in this country is very much in this trans-race moment, or trans-age.

“Don’t be surprised if some child says I was born Caucasian, I’m black, and if you see them being tattooed, I told you so.”

Mr Ablow has previously claimed allowing same-sex couples to marry will lead to ‘three humans and a dog’ marriage.
