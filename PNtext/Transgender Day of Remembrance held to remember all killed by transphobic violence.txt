Transgender Day of Remembrance held to remember all killed by transphobic violence

Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR) is taking place today with vigils and memorial events around the world.

TDoR is held to remember people who have died as a result of their actual or perceived transgender identity.

The events were first held in 1998, the following the murder of Rita Hester, a transgender African American woman in Massachusetts.

Campaigners continue to warn figures, already high, are likely to be higher as transphobic crime remains underreported – and not all jurisdictions document or treat the cases accordingly.

A long list of participating venues is available on the TDoR website, including several locations in London and across the UK.

The site also includes a frighteningly long memorial list of trans people killed in the past year.
