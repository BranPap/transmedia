Fox host: Comedy shows should mock ‘transgender bathrooms’, not ISIS

A Fox News host has suggested that Saturday Night Live should mock trans people going to the toilet – instead of targeting ISIS.

Tucker Carlson, who is a Fox & Friends co-host, made the comments in reaction to a skit mocking Toyota’s Superbowl advert, in which a father sees his daughter off to fight in the military.

In the Saturday Night Live spoof of the ad, a man instead sees his daughter off to go fight for Islamic State.

Mr Carlson attacked the ad, saying: “The question is, should we be mocking ISIS?”

He continued: “I’m kind of for comedy that goes as far as it can, but I always feel like with shows like SNL and comedy in general, it does stop short of the sacred cows on the left.

“I would love to see an SNL sketch like making fun of transgender bathrooms, for example.

“You will never, ever see that. Why? Because it’s just too far. There actually is a line, it’s just a different line than most of us perceive.”

In January, a Republican State Senator in Kentucky proposed a bill that would offer students money if they report trans students going to the toilet.

Senator Embry’s bill will force schools to comply by offering a reward of $2,500 (£1,650) to any student who reports a trans student violating the law.
