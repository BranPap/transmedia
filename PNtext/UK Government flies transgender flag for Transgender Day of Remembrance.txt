UK Government flies transgender flag for Transgender Day of Remembrance

A UK Government building is flying the transgender flag in honour of Transgender Day of Remembrance for the first time.

The Department of Education has become the first Government department to fly the flag for the international memorial day for transgender people who have been unlawfully killed.



Nicky Morgan, who is the Secretary of State for Education and Minister for Women and Equalities told Buzzfeed that she was “proud that for the first time a government department is flying the transgender flag

“We have come a long way when it comes to raising awareness and increasing support for transgender individuals.

“But we must continue to make further progress and ensure all members of our society can live their lives free from fear, and able to fulfil their potential.”

Earlier this year the minister expressed her delight that the Department of Education flew the pride flag to celebrate this year’s London Pride.

This years Transgender Day of Remembrance is marking the unlawful deaths of 271 transgender people across the world. 

However in the UK this year’s day of remembrance has been largely dominated by the news that trans woman Vicky Thompson was found dead inside the men’s prison where she was serving a 12 month sentence.

Earlier today Labour MP Cat Smith raised an urgent question in Parliament concerning Thompson’s death.

Ms Morgan has previously said the Government is “open” to letting people ‘self declare’ their gender where she was giving oral evidence to the Women and Equalities select committee transgender equality inquiry.
