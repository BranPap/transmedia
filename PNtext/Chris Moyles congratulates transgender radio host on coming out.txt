Chris Moyles congratulates transgender radio host on coming out

Former Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles has congratulated a local radio presenter who came out on air as transgender yesterday.

Stephanie Hirst, 39 – until now known as Simon Hirst – made the revelation yesterday, on National Coming Out Day.

Ms Hirst previously hosted the ‘Hirsty’s Daily Dose’ breakfast show on Capital FM Yorkshire, but abruptly left the station in June.

She told BBC Radio 5 Live: “There were many times on the air in recent years where I nearly said that I’m transgender.

“I knew from around the same time that I knew I wanted to be on the radio that something wasn’t right.

“I didn’t feel complete, I didn’t feel like it locked. I felt like a square peg in a round hole but I didn’t know why and I couldn’t work it out.”

Former Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles – who was Radio 1’s longest serving presenter before he quit in 2012 – tweeted his support for Stephanie Hirst.

He said: “140 characters is just not enough to explain how proud I am of my dear friend Stephanie Hirst and the life she will now lead. It’s all good!”

Ms Hirst added: “I have been overwhelmed by the love and support you have shown me tonight.”

Chris Moyles was named Stonewall Bully of the Year in 2006, after he refused to apologise for describing a ring tone that he didn’t like as “gay”.
