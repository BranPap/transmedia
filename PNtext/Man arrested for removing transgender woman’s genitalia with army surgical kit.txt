Man arrested for removing transgender woman’s genitalia with army surgical kit

A man has been arrested and faces felony assault charges after he removed a transgender woman’s genitalia. 

James Pennington, who is not medically licensed, attempted to remove the woman’s testicles.



The anonymous woman was at Pennington’s house with her wife when he performed “surgery” on her.

Pennington, from Colorado, used an army surgical kit to carry out the procedure, including a scalpel, lidocaine, medical dressing and other equipment.

Before starting the procedure, which took 90 minutes, it is believed that Pennington told the woman’s wife to phone emergency services if complications arose. 

The police records from the incident show that Pennington is not medically licensed but rather holds a pilot’s license.

They also stated that Pennington “used the scalpel and surgically disconnected and removed the victim’s two testicles and the sutured the opening back up.”

The 57-year-old has since admitted his guilt.

While it is unclear under what circumstances the woman decided to seek out the surgery from Pennington, it is believed that she will suffer long-term side effects because of the botched surgery.

She is being held at the Medical Centre of Aurora after her wife discovered a “large amount” of blood coming from the wound when changing the dressings. 

The woman’s doctors have said that she is at risk of “permanent disfigurement”. 

A trans teen, Symone Marie Jones, died after receiving silicone injections from an unlicensed plastic surgeon. 

42-year-old Kavonceya Iman Cornelius used non-medical grade silicone which “cut” the lungs of the 19-year-old.

A transgender man in California recently launched a lawsuit against the Mercy San Juan Centre hospital because they refused to perform gender reassignment surgery on him. 

Evan Michael Minton was seeking out a hysterectomy but was refused on the basis of the hospital’s ties to the Catholic church.
