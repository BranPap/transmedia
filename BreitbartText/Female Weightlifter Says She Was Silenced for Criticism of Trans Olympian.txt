Female Weightlifter Says She Was Silenced for Criticism of Trans Olympian

New Zealand weightlifter Tracey Lambrechs alleges that her country’s weightlifting authorities attempted to silence her over her criticism of trans weightlifter Laurel Hubbard.

With Lambrechs’ retirement, one of the competitors taking her place is Laurel Hubbard, the athlete who became the first transgender weightlifter to be allowed to compete in the women’s categories in Olympics history.

But now that she is retired and beyond the power of New Zealand’s sports authorities, Lambrechs is speaking out, at long last, after years of being told to stay quiet about Hubbard’s bid to be accepted as a female athlete in New Zealand.

“I was told if I wanted to go to the next Commonwealth Games I needed to lose 18 kilograms [about 40 pounds] in three months or retire” Lambrechs told National Review. “Losing that much weight quickly was not ideal for my health and I suffered some severe migraines and started passing out a lot.”

Lambrechs added that when she raised her concerns over Hubbard she was told to pipe down and be “resilient.”

“Psychologically speaking it’s very upsetting and stressful,” she said of her efforts to stay a viable athlete in her chosen field.

Lambrechs added that other athletes didn’t have the support system to make such drastic changes to their athletic training and Hubbard’s arrival affected them much harder.

“We were told not to talk to the media and were warned that if we did, we could bring the sport into disrepute and then could miss out on being selected or could be dropped from national teams,” Lambrechs continued. “The sports national body did not know how to handle the situation, so they had a knee-jerk reaction and thought silence would be best for them.”

Lambrechs added that she has no personal animosity towards Hubbard.

“At the end of the day, this hasn’t been easy for Laurel either. The outcome I’m hoping for is the safety of women’s sports and the inclusion of transgendered athletes where they can participate in sport at what ever level and not be bullied or harassed,” Lambrechs said.

The IOC has crafted what it claims to be fair standards by ruling that athletes who claim to be transgender women can compete as women if their testosterone levels are below 10 nanomoles per liter for a minimum of twelve months prior to competing. However, this still puts transgender athletes at an advantage because the average female’s testosterone is naturally around 2.5 nanomoles per liter and less. This allows transgender athletes a nearly five times higher testosterone rate over their natural born female counterparts.
