Not Enough LGBT Events? UK City to Introduce Another Pride March Just for Trans People

Not content with the existing slate of LGBT days, weeks, and months already available, a transgender activist group to organise yet another Pride day, just for trans people, in England’s second city.

“There are a lot more obstacles to being accepted in society if you’re trans,” said “Mx” Khan, as BirminghamLive described the activist.

“We need to specifically target these challenges to overcome them, and the people in the best place to do that are the trans community themselves,” Khan added.

British cities including the hyper-diverse capital of London and the woke-left stronghold of Brighton already have dedicated trans pride events.

“#PrideSeason takes place from June to September with local events across the country celebrating the resilience and spirit of #LGBTQ2 people in Canada,” declared an account run by the Canadian government’s 2SLGBTQI+ Secretariat in June.

2SLGBTQI+ or LGBTQIA2S+ is the latest and most impressive acronym for what was once simply the gay and, later, LGBT community, covering people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, “queer”, intersex, asexual, two-spirit — a person “whose gender identity, spiritual identity and/or sexual orientation comprises both male and female spirits” — and more.
