WATCH: First Promo for ‘I Am Cait’ Jenner Reality TV Show

The first promo for the Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner reality TV show I Am Cait debuted on Today Wednesday morning.

“How many people go through life and just waste their entire life because they never deal with themselves, with who they are?” Jenner says at the start of the 60-second spot. 

“Living for the first time as the person he feels he was born to be, the docuseries will also explore what Bruce’s transition means for the people in his life and how those relationships are affected, while offering a better understanding of many of life’s challenges,” E! said in the statement.

The promo follows Jenner as he applies makeup in a mirror and drives “out into the world.”

“It’s so bright out there, look at that,” Jenner says from the backseat of a car. “Isn’t it great that maybe someday you’ll be normal? Just blend into society?”

“You are normal,” a woman interjects.

“Put it this way: I’m the new normal,” Jenner replies.

I Am Cait debuts July 26 on E!
