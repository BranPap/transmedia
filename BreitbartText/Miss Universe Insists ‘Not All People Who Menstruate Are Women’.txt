Miss Universe Insists ‘Not All People Who Menstruate Are Women’

Miss Universe is claiming that “not all people who menstruate are women,” and shared “inclusive language” guidelines to its Twitter account on Tuesday, instructing the public to say “people” have periods, not “women.”


“Thinking menstrual health is only a niche topic for woman excludes transgender, non-binary and gender-nonconforming people who have periods from the conversation,” Miss Universe added, along with the hashtag, “Menstrual Equity.”

Inclusive language is important, especially when speaking about periods.

Including in its tweet, Miss Universe instructed the public on “How to talk about periods,” adding, “Say this: productive health. Not this: women’s health.”

“Say this: people who have periods. Not this: women who have periods,” the instructions continued, before claiming that “Not all women menstruate and not all people who menstruate are women.”

Meanwhile, biological males are increasingly dominating spheres that once belonged to biological women.

Women’s beauty pageants are not the only place biological males are beginning to conquer.

Transgender models Valentina Sampaio and Leyna Bloom have both appeared in Sports Illustrated‘s annual Swimsuit Issue. Now, Celebrity Big Brother star and transgender model Jessica Alves is vying to be on the cover of Playboy magazine following a Brazilian butt lift surgery.
