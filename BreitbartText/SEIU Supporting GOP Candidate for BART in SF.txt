SEIU Supporting GOP Candidate for BART in SF

 

In the unlikeliest of scenarios, the hardline leftist Service Employees International Union (SEIU) Local 1021 is essentially supporting a GOP candidate for a seat on the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Board of Directors. 

Supervisor Scott Wiener, befuddled, said, “It’s an odd thing. Here you have this uber-progressive union, yet they are supporting a Republican candidate in San Francisco against an environmental progressive,” reported the San Francisco Chronicle.

Agnos said Fang has labor’s support because he walked the picket line in last year’s BART worker strike. He added, “Until now I would characterize Fang’s relationship with labor as benign neglect. This is one of the few times he’s been in support of labor. He took advantage of this strike because it was an election year.”

Josefowitz has strong support from the rest of the left; he has been endorsed by The Chronicle, the Examiner, the Sierra Club, the Alice B. Toklas Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Democratic Club, and seven of the 11 San Francisco supervisors, the Chronicle reports.
