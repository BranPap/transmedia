E! Releases Teaser Video on Kardashians Confronting Bruce Jenner’s Transitioning

E! has released a one-minute teaser video of the upcoming two-part episode focused on Bruce Jenner and the Kardashians coming to grips with Jenner’s transitioning to a woman.

“I just don’t like when people say Bruce is gonna be gone,” Kendall Jenner says during the teaser video. Bruce then responds, “I’m not going anywhere.”

As the video winds down, Bruce says, “I don’t think I’ve ever been as scared in my life as I was to be extraordinarily honest with my kids.”

The two-part episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians will be broadcast on E! on May 18 and 19 at 9PM Eastern.

Jenner came out to the world with his intention to live as a woman during a special interview last month with Diane Sawyer. The former Olympian raised eyebrows in several ways, not the least of which was his claim that he is a conservative-minded Christian despite the announcement of his transition into a woman.

One possible issue for Jenner, though, comes in the form of a lawsuit for wrongful death recently filed against him for his part in a fatal car accident from earlier in the year.

No official charges have yet been filed against Jenner for the accident, but the family of the woman killed during the crash say Jenner is responsible for the death of their loved one.
