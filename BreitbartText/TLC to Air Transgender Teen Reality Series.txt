TLC to Air Transgender Teen Reality Series

TLC network will become the latest network to jump into the transgender programming market this summer, with the debut of All That Jazz, a reality show about 14-year-old transgender activist and You Tube star Jazz Jennings.

Jennings, who is being hailed as “The New Face of Transgender Youth,” has previously been featured on ABC’s 20/20, as well as The Rosie Show, where the Jennings family shared the story of Jazz’s transgender youth.

Jazz’s story is universal, yet unique, and we’re proud to partner with her family to share it with TLC’s audience… Jazz may be known as an author and activist, but she’s first and foremost a teenage girl with a big, brave heart, living a remarkable life.

Added TLC president Marjorie Kaplan: “We know that families come in all shapes and sizes, but at their core, they are all about love, acceptance, and support. Only TLC can tell this family’s story in way that celebrates and demystifies difference in an effort to help create a world without prejudice.”

Born male, Jazz was reportedly diagnosed with gender identity disorder in 2004, due to an expressed desire for things typically associated with girls.

In 2014, Time magazine listed Jennings as one of the 25 Most Influential Teens of the year.

Jennings also co-authored a children’s book about transgender teen life, titled I Am Jazz, with author Jessica Herthel.

All That Jazz will premiere on the network some time this summer.

Yahoo‘s Katie Couric sat down with Jennings last November to discuss transgender life:
