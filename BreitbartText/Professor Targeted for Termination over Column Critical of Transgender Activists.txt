Professor Targeted for Termination over Column Critical of Transgender Activists

Boise State Professor Scott Yenor has been targeted for termination by students after he published a column critical of transgender activists.

Yenor published a column in The Daily Signal that criticized a new law passed in Canada that would prevent families from adopting children if such parents would refuse to acknowledge a child’s chosen gender identity. “This can be seen in the Canadian province of Ontario, which passed a law allowing state agencies to prevent families that will not affirm a child’s chosen “gender identity” from adopting or providing foster care to children,” he wrote.”

During a campus debate that took place on September 25, some students argued that Yenor’s column could be considered hate speech. Others called for him to be terminated.

An op-ed in the school’s student newspaper entitled “Fire Scott Yenor” makes the case for his termination. “Women, survivors, and queer folk shouldn’t have to learn constitutional law from a slut-shaming trans-phobe who isn’t even in favor of gay marriage,” the student wrote.

The President of Boise State’s Young Democrats is also calling for Yenor to be fired. In a statement made to a local television station, Joe Goode argued that Yenor’s column is hate speech. “In our belief, this is hate speech, and it’s alienating a lot of folks in this Boise State community,” he said. “We want to show that our university stands for more than hate, we are a community of equality and inclusivity.”
