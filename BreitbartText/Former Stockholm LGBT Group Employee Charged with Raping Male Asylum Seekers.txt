Former Stockholm LGBT Group Employee Charged with Raping Male Asylum Seekers

A former employee of the Stockholm branch of the Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Rights (RFSL) has been charged over allegations he raped male asylum seekers.

Prosecutor Paulina Pilati of the City Prosecutor’s Office in Stockholm stated that the man preyed on the vulnerability of the asylum seekers who came to him for advice on how to remain in the country and avoid deportation, broadcaster SVT reports.

“They have understood that they have to have sex with him to get help to stay in Sweden. The plaintiffs have not participated voluntarily,” the prosecutor added.

Last month, the Stockholm branch of the RFSL admitted they had known about the allegations of rape and sexual assault for months before the incidents were reported to the police.

The incident is just the latest case in which an activist or volunteer helping migrants has been accused of sexual abuse.

 

According to a 2018 report from the UK Commons international development committee, sexual abuse is “endemic” across the international aid sector and accused NGOs of ignoring the problem or being complicit in it.
