Women Working on Amazons’ Transparent’ Afraid to Complain About Gender Neutral Bathrooms

Production crew members working on Amazon’s original transgender series Transparent are uncomfortable after management made all bathrooms on the set gender neutral — particularly women.

Amid a nationwide debate about public restroom privacy, TMZ reports the award-winning show made its facilities unisex. Despite the show being centered around a man’s journey to live his life as woman, not everyone on the crew is comfortable sharing bathrooms.

In addition to feeling uncomfortable sharing bathrooms, those with privacy complaints are too afraid to take their grievances to management out of fear they will be labeled “transphobic.”

Amazon has not commented on the TMZ report.

The show’s third season will premiere some time in 2016.

Transparent is partially based on the family of its creator and showrunner Jill Soloway, whose father is transgender. Many of her show’s actors and crew members also identify as transgender.
