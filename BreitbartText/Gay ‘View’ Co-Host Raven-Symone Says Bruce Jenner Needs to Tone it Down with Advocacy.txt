Gay ‘View’ Co-Host Raven-Symone Says Bruce Jenner Needs to Tone it Down with Advocacy

The View co-host and former Disney child star Raven-Symone says Bruce Jenner has jumped the gun on becoming a high-profile advocate for the transgender community after his transition.

Jenner announced in April he was “for all intents and purposes” a woman, but the Cosby Show child actress, who came out in 2014 but refuses to be labeled as “gay,” said during Monday’s episode Jenner should’ve waited.

“You’ve got to learn it first, and she’s not, really,” she added.

While exiting panelist Rosie Perez suggested Jenner was being strategic with his moves, Symone continued to say the former Olympic athlete has moved “too fast, too soon.”

Symone doesn’t claim the title as a gay rights activist, saying “I can’t be. I learned from the real gay rights activists. I can only do what I can.”
