Cher Urges ‘LGBTQ Friends to Mobilize’ Because ‘Trump’s Pulled the Plug on Democracy’

Left-wing pop icon Cher called on LGBT people to “mobilize” on Tuesday following news that the Trump administration would rescind Obama-era policies treating anti-transgender discrimination as sexism.

Cher claimed that the Department of Health and Human Services’ choice to go along with the courts was evidence President Donald Trump had “pulled the plug on democracy.”

The 2016 provision added “gender identity” to the same category of discrimination as sexism, defining the term as one’s “internal sense of being male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female.”

“When Congress prohibited sex discrimination, it did so according to the plain meaning of the term, and we are making our regulations conform,” said Roger Severino, director of the HHS Office for Civil Rights. “We have concluded in our most recent filing with the court that discrimination on the basis of sex does not cover gender identity.”

Cher has won admiration in conservative circles after making various statements that go against the political left’s agenda. Last month, she complained that the city of Los Angeles “can’t take care of its own” residents and does not have the bandwidth to care for illegal immigrants.

Barely a week after her comments on immigration, Cher also blasted proposals by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders to let felons and terrorists vote. “Excuse The [fuck] Out Of Me If I don’t want ,Murders, Rapists, &; CHILD MOLESTERS of every color to vote,” she said at the time.
