Obama Uses Social Media to Praise Bruce Jenner’s Transition

President Obama weighed in on Bruce Jenner’s transformation into Caitlyn Jenner on this month’s cover of Vanity Fair, hailing the former Olympian for having the “courage” to do so publicly.

Jenner, who came out as transgender in last month’s widely-viewed 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer, broke the President’s record for being fastest to reach 1 million followers on Twitter on Monday. Jenner accomplished the feat in just four hours, while it had previously taken Obama five.

The president also asked followers to share their stories at Obama’s own Organizing for Action website.
