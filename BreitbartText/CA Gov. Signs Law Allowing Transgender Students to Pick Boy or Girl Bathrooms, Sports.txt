(AP) Calif. governor signs transgender-student billSACRAMENTO, Calif.California has become the first state to enshrine certain rights for transgender K-12 students in state law, requiring public schools to allow those students access to whichever restroom and locker room they want.

Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown announced Monday that he had signed AB1266. The new law gives students the right “to participate in sex-segregated programs, activities and facilities” based on their self-perception and regardless of their birth gender.

Detractors said allowing students of one gender to use facilities intended for the other could invade the other students’ privacy.
