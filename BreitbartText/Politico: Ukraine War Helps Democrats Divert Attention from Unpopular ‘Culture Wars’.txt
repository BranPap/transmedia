Politico: Ukraine War Helps Democrats Divert Attention from Unpopular ‘Culture Wars’

The Ukraine war is good news for Democrats because it distracts from their unpopular domestic issues, an article in Politico magazine argues.

“Dems catch a break from the culture wars: War in Ukraine and the domestic economic fallout have given Democrats a chance to focus there instead of on other issues that dominated 2021,” read the headline on the lead story by David Siders and Elena Schneider in the Saturday morning layout at Politico’s website.

However, the article then adds that the Ukraine war and “ensuing economic fallout” have now “given the Democrats a chance to put those matters aside and focus on an unlikely, more favorable set of issues eight months before the midterms.”

The article continues:

The vast majority of Black workers who lost their jobs said they were still looking for work a year after the start of the pandemic (68%), even as employers across the country complained that they couldn’t find anyone amidst persistent labor shortages.

That’s according to the CARE at Work survey of nearly 2,000 Black workers in Southern California about their experience during the pandemic. The survey was conducted from May 2021 to July 2021.

“Black workers in times of crisis, in times of economic recessions and downturns, are oftentimes the first to be let go from work, and then the last to be hired back,” Déjà Thomas, the report’s lead author, told Business Insider.

Under President Donald Trump’s low-immigration policies, however, black unemployment dropped to record lows.
