Trans Activists Shout Down 80-Year-Old Woman Protesting Against Men in Girls’ Locker Rooms

Transgender activists harassed an 80-year-old woman as she attempted to give a speech in opposition to the presence of men in girls’ locker rooms.

Jaman told Reduxx that she became concerned when she saw a man dressed in a women’s bathing suit in the women’s locker room watching little girls as they removed their bathing suits. 

Jaman spoke out against the YMCA’s decision to allow men in the same locker room as young girls at a protest. Activists can be seen tearing down suffragette flags behind Jaman and shouting her down, prompting her to ask her supporters to call the police.

The 80-year-old woman who was banned from her local swimming pool for raising concerns about a male in the female washroom was heckled as she gave a speech tonight.

The transgender activists attempted to drown out the 80-year-old woman’s speech with chants of “trans rights are human rights” and “trans women are women.”

One attendee of the protest took to social media, remarking, “They didn’t want to let women speak. They got physical with us but we all spoke….Men were being bullies.”

Port Townsend was intense. They didn't want to let women speak. They got physical with us but we all spoke. Nobody got hurt or arrested. Men were being bullies. We had to form a protective circle. This was the most aggressive man. #LetJulieSwim #LetWomenSpeak pic.twitter.com/zdPuaqTjm4

A pro-trans activist gloated on social media, calling it “an incredible night,” claiming they “showed up in huge and beautiful fashion to say that hate has no place here.”

What an incredible night. The Port Townsend community showed up in huge and beautiful fashion to say that hate has no place here. Trans and cis-allies alike spoke love & support, and the only TERF speaker was from out of town. Tonight reminded me why Port Townsend is home. ❤️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
