Kathleen Turner to Star in Off Broadway, Transgender Lesbian Play

Oscar-nominated Actress Kathleen Turner will co-star in an upcoming off Broadway play about a lesbian struggling with gender identity issues.

Would You Still Love Me If…, which will debut at off Broadway’s New World Stages on October 10, tells the story of an expectant lesbian couple, one of whom is considering a sex change.

John S. Anastasi, a playwright from Pennsylvania, penned the production after becoming inspired by a film about two lesbians, and said Turner volunteered herself for the role after his casting director put out a call for actors.

Would You Still Love Me If… drew inspiration from the coming-of-age romance Blue Is The Warmest Colour.

Turner previously played the role of Charles Bing, the father of Chandler Bing, in the long running ‘90s sitcom Friends.

John S. Anastasi has written two previous off Broadway productions, including 2013’s I Forgive You, Ronald Reagan.
