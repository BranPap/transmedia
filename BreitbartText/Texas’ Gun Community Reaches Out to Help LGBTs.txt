Texas’ Gun Community Reaches Out to Help LGBTs

Texans are tough but they are also big-hearted souls, and those in the gun community are no exception. They have reached out to the LGBT community by offering free CHL classes and escorts to Gay Pride events in Texas.

Grisham said that members of OCT have offered to provide visibly armed escorts at LGBT events in order to achieve several objectives. He said the first is to hopefully encourage the gay community to arm and train themselves for self defense so they can respond to any threats against them.

He added, “Finally, we want to send a clear message that the American people are united against hate and Islamic extremism and we will not be victims. We stand with every community in opposing violence, regardless of the manner in which it is perpetrated.”

Grisham said that no one in his group is a “vigilante.” He added, “We are not looking for a fight.” On the contrary he explained, “We wish to help by preventing any fights based on our mere presence.” He said that “guns are designed to be a tool of last resort after all other efforts at a peaceful resolution have been exhausted.”

Any group, organization or individual wishing to accept OCT’s offer of free armed escorts can contact the group at admin@opencarrytexas.org or 832-87-CARRY.

Gay Pride events are scheduled in Dallas, El Paso, and Houston in June, but OCT did not limit their escort service offer to any particular time period. OCT has members in every major city and in 249 counties.

The Shiloh Gun Range in far northwest Harris County, Texas, is offering a free CHL class to those in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community. A notice on their website says, “WE offer our prayers and support to the LGBT community, and classes to those interested in taking this new CHL class please call 281-444-8930.”

The owner of the shooting range, Jeff Sanford, told the local CBS affiliate, “We want to make them aware they can come here, they can feel safe here, they can get their concealed handgun license or their license to carry and they can carry a gun and they can feel good about it.”

An employee at the range, Ryan Thomas came up with the idea. He has a concealed handgun license, and he is also gay. He told KPRC, “We wanted to reach out to them and say hey, we might not totally understand what’s going on, but we feel for you and this is what we can do to help you out.”

Thomas said, “We have a right to carry. We have a right to protect ourselves. And it’s a different time. We should all know how to do this.”
