Cancel Mob Calls ‘American Horror Story’ Star Sarah Paulson ‘B*tch, C*nt, Whore,’ for Not Declaring Pronouns

American Horror Story actress Sarah Paulson is facing the wrath of the cancel culture mob for refusing to put her pronouns in her Twitter bio.

It’s also not that hard for you to not tell what to do 🏼‍♀️

Her retort prompted a wave of angry insults calling the actress a “bitch,” “cunt,” and “whore.” Some even attacked Paulson’s partner, Two and a Half Men actress Holland Taylor.

Paulson has used her Twitter account with more than 1.1 million followers to repeatedly attack then President Donald Trump. She promoted the ultimately unsuccessful effort to flip Texas blue and even said she would be happy to play Trump in a future season of American Horror Story.

Paulson is next set to appear as Linda Tripp in the next season of American Crime Story, which will focus on the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
