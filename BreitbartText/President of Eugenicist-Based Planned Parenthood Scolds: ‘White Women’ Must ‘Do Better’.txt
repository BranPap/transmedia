President of Eugenicist-Based Planned Parenthood Scolds: ‘White Women’ Must ‘Do Better’

The president of Planned Parenthood – the nation’s largest abortion business – lectured white women at the women’s Trump resistance march about their failure to support women of color.

Richards heads up an organization founded by eugenicist Margaret Sanger and which performed over 320,000 abortions last year – predominantly on black and Hispanic babies – yet she scolded white, heterosexual women for failing to do their part to elect more pro-abortion women to public office.

All across the country, the Women’s March inspired doctors and teachers and mothers to become activists and organizers and, yes, candidates for office. And from Virginia to Alabama and to last week in Wisconsin, women have beaten the odds to elect our own to office. … Women of color, transgender women, rural and urban women. These victories were led and made possible by women of color.

To my fellow white women: We have got to do better. It is not up to women of color to save this country from itself. That's on all of us. #PowerToThePolls @womensmarch

According to statistics from the New York Times, 53 percent of white, female voters voted for Trump over failed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Additionally, 44 percent of college-educated white female voters voted for Trump.

We are all here because our lives are touched by the Trump administration’s heartless, dangerous policies. We are all here because we want to expand and protect our rights. We are the resistance, and it is strong. #WomensMarch2018 pic.twitter.com/ruYKVCFERt

About 59 million abortions have been performed in the country since the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, nearly 18 million of them on black babies. As Breitbart News has reported, the Alan Guttmacher Institute – a pro-abortion rights group – has also provided data showing that about 30 percent of all abortions in the U.S. are performed on black women, with another 25 percent performed on Hispanic women.

Planned Parenthood has also condemned the U.S. House’s passage Friday of a bill that would require abortionists to provide emergency medical treatment to an infant who was born alive during an abortion. The measure reflects the fact that abortionist Kermit Gosnell was convicted in 2013 of murdering babies born alive during abortions by cutting their spinal cords.

Richards’ organization is now under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice following allegations of profiteering from the sale of body parts of babies aborted in its clinics.

The abortion business has attached itself to every leftwing political identity group in the hopes of garnering enough support to keep its taxpayer funding – amounting to nearly $544 million – all while its profits rose last year $21 million, or 27 percent, from the prior year.

Planned Parenthood’s “innovations” in health care announced in its latest annual report include over one million appointments that were booked at its clinics online within the past year, a “gender neutral” app that helps women and transgender men keep track of their menstrual periods and birth control, and the fact that its affiliates in 17 states now offer hormone treatments for transgender individuals who are uncomfortable with their biological sex.

We won’t stop fighting until all women and all people can control their body and their life. Today we march, tomorrow we win. #WMWRI18 #StandWithPP pic.twitter.com/c3Z8a07ql1

This year’s women’s marches were also once again fraught with controversy among leftwing groups attempting to appear unified, yet clearly tripping up over their own fears of not holding to a certain level of politically correct messages.

Though the “pink pussyhats” were out in full force during women’s marches throughout the country, many march leaders were demanding they be abandoned for fear of offending women of color and those biological men who claim to be women.

According to a report in the Detroit Free Press, the pink pussyhat “excludes and is offensive to transgender women and gender non-binary people who don’t have typical female genitalia and to women of color because their genitals are more likely to be brown than pink,”

“I personally won’t wear one because if it hurts even a few people’s feelings, then I don’t feel like it’s unifying,” said Michigan women’s march president, Phoebe Hopps, ahead of the march. “I care more about mobilizing people to the polls than wearing one hat one day of the year.”

According to the news report, women’s march state and national groups were ditching the pussyhats because they send the wrong message.

“It doesn’t sit well with a group of people that feel that the pink pussyhats are either vulgar or they are upset that they might not include trans women or nonbinary women or maybe women whose (genitals) are not pink,” Hopps said.



 On my way to the immigration march in Washington this morning, and using the train ride to learn how to knit my own pink hat for the Women's March next Saturday! I was so inspired by the women producers @thedailyshow who were knitting theirs the other night I figured why not try myself! If you want to yourself go to @p_ssyhatproject – easy instructions and you can calm yourself for the week through meditative knitting! @womensmarch @ppact 💝

Last year, Richards herself, however, engaged in what is now apparently racist and transphobic behavior, according to women’s march leaders themselves, sharing on Instagram the knitting of her own pink pussyhat.

“On my way to the immigration march in Washington this morning,” she wrote, “and using the train ride to learn how to knit my own pink hat for the Women’s March next Saturday!”
