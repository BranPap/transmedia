Supreme Court to Hear Cases on LGBT Issues in Workplaces

WASHINGTON, DC – The Supreme Court announced on Monday that later this year the justices will hear arguments on whether federal law forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, in the first major LGBT cases since Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement.

Title VII in federal law forbids discrimination on various bases, including race and sex. For years, LGBT activists tried to get Congress to amend Title VII to cover sexual identity and gender identity. When those efforts proved unsuccessful, those activists switched gears to argue that the term “sex” in Title VII already covers gay and transgender individuals, and therefore that new legislation is not necessary.

Now the Supreme Court will weigh in on the matter. The justices granted writs of certiorari to review two cases in which gay persons claimed they were discriminated against by their employers. These cases have been consolidated for one hour of oral argument.

The Court also took a case from the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) involving a funeral home. In that case, a man who previously dressed as a man now identifies as female and was terminated for insisting on wearing women’s clothing and using a woman’s name.

The sexual orientation cases are Bostock v. Clayton County, No. 17-1618, and Altitude Express v. Zarda, No. 17-1623, at the Supreme Court of the United States.

The transgender case is R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC, No. 18-107 at the Supreme Court of the United States.
