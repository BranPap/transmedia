James Woods: ‘Transgender’ Claims ‘Do Serious Harm’ To Youths

Actor James Woods stepped up his criticism of the transgender ideology July 26 by ridiculing a staged photo which suggests that men can have menstrual periods.

Overall, the image is designed to push the transgender strategy of splitting the definition of  “man” and “woman” from male and female biology. Instead of that biological definition, transgender activists are pushing the academic-invented idea that each person has a male or female “gender” — which they say means that a person with a male gender and a female body can be called a “man.”

Woods ridicules the menstrual blood image, slams the culture damage caused by the Baby Boom generation, and slams parents who don’t stop their sexually confused children from using drugs and surgeries to mutilate their bodies.

Amen! I'm in the Baby Boom generation and I have said repeatedly that my generation has done more cultural damage than any in history. https://t.co/wnOz2vBqG0

And the parents using their kids as PC  cannon fodder on the front lines of the #transgender culture wars are the most reprehensible.

The image was posted on Instagram by Cass Clemmer, a young woman who describes herself as “trans.” She is also the author of a book for kids which boosts transgenderism, titled “Toni The Tampon.”



 Y’all know I’m trans and queer, And what that means for me all around, Is something that’s neither there nor here, It’s a happy, scary middle ground.  So when I talk gender inclusion, And I wrote these rhymes to help you see, I’m not tryna bring up something shallow, Periods are honestly pretty traumatic for me.  See my life is very clearly marked, Like a red border cut up a nation, A time before and a time beyond, The mark of my first menstruation.  So let me take you back, To the details that I can still recall, Of the day I gained my first period, And the day that I lost it all.  I was 15 and still happy, Running around, all chest bared and buck, Climbing trees, digging holes, And no one gave a single fuck.  I mean I think my ma was worried, So I went and grew out my locks, A sign I was normal, still a girl, A painted neon sign for my gender box.  So, the day I got my period, My god, a day so proud, This little andro fucked up kid, Had been bestowed the straight, cis shroud.  The relief got all meshed up in my pain, In that moment, I sat down and cried, Just thanking god I was normal, While mourning the freedom that had died.  Everyone told me my hips would grow, I looked at them and couldn't stop crying, "What's wrong with you? You'll be a woman!" They kept celebrating a child dying. See my body had betrayed me, That red dot, the wax seal, On a contract left there broken, A gender identity that wasn’t real.  Most people deal with blood and tissue, And yet my body forces me to surrender, Cause every time I get my cycle, Is another day I shed my gender.  My boobs betray me first, I feel them stretching out my binder, I send up questions, "am I cursed?" And wish to god that she was kinder.  The five days it flows, I try to breathe, I dissociate, While my body rips outs parts of me, Leaving nothing but a shell of hate.  The blood drips from an open wound, Of a war waging deep inside my corpse, The battle between mind and body, Immovable object; unstoppable force. #bleedingwhiletrans #menstruator #genderinclusion #mencanmenstruate #protectranskids #periodpride #genderdysphoria #menstruationmatters #ifmenhadperiods [PLEASE SHARE!🌈]

Woods properly urges support for the few youths who are in turmoil over their sexual development. The medical jargon for youths who are worried about the emergence of their male or female body is “gender dysphoria.”

But compassion for gender dysphoria is of paramount importance, however. One need not embrace a ridiculous PC narrative to be compassionate. https://t.co/DWQQB1CaFM

And it is EXACTLY these absurd self-serving memes that do serious harm to young men and women genuinely struggling with gender dysphoria… pic.twitter.com/ePHamguM2z

Woods also made sure to hit the core claim of “gender” that underlies the entire “transgender movement.”

The “gender” word has long been used as a grammatical feature in French and other languages which refer to items — such as houses, bread or bicycles — using male or female grammar and pronouns, equivalent to “she,” “he,” or “it.” English does not have his linguistic feature because it uses “it” to refer to things, such as pizzas, fish, or a person’s biological sex.

Transgender activists are trying to end the use of biological sex when determining whether a person is male or female — partly because they also want to destroy the idea of “the two sexes,” which they decry as the “gender binary.” Instead of the two sexes, they wish to see a society where even very young people can easily choose from a wide variety of mix-and-match “genders” instead of living with their own bodies’ male or female sex, regardless of the physical, emotional and social risks to children.

"Gender" has always referred to a distinction between pronouns. "Sex" was distinguished by chromosomes and genitalia. #SimpleScience

Before the new idea of “gender,” troubled youths would learn to live with their own biological sex, often by becoming gay or lesbian.

But the activists’ promise that “gender” is more important than biology encourages some youths to embark on a very risky “transgender” journey of drugs, hormone, and surgeries that leave them sterilized, trapped between two sexes and limited to a very narrow circle of friends, romantic partners, and potential spouses.

The transgender ideology also demands that the federal government force Americans to accept “gender identity” sex-switching claims made by each person, regardless of scientific data about genetics, biology, and the variety of normal behavior and appearances shown by normal, equal, different, and complementary women and men, boys and girls.

The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender” has already attacked and cracked popular social rules for how Americans handle the many differences between different, complementary and equal men and women. These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, women’s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children’s sexual privacy.

That transgender goal is also opposed some gays, by some former transgender people, and some feminists.

Woods has been slammed by transgender activists because of his support for science and his advice to troubled youths. On Thursday, he tweeted his contempt for his critics:
