Joe Biden Promises to ‘Eliminate’ Donald Trump’s Sex vs. Gender Policies

Joe Biden promised to reverse President Donald Trump’s executive orders that sidelined the pro-transgender policies imposed by former President Barack Obama.

Since 2017, Trump has used his power of the presidency to reject the pro-transgender rules set by President Barack Obama.

The woman asked at the October 15 town hall event:

The Trump administration has attacked the rights of transgender people, banning them from military service, weakening non-discrimination protections, and even removing the word “transgender” from some government websites. How will you, as president, reverse this dangerous and discriminatory agenda and ensure that the lives and rights of LGBTQ people are protected under U.S. law?

Biden indicated he accepted the claim that children can make lifetime medical decisions — even before puberty — and said:

The idea that an eight-year-0ld child or a ten-year-old child decides, “You know, I decided I want to be transgender. That’s what I think I’d like to be — it’ll make my life a lot easier!”

There should be zero discrimination … and so I promise you, there is no reason to suggest that there should be any right denied your daughter — or daughters, whichever, one or two, your daughter — that your other daughter has a right to be or do. None. Zero.

Many critics of pro-transgender policies say that children’s sexual confusion is usually resolved by puberty, or by the adoption of a gay or lesbian orientation, and say that transgender drugs are dangerous to the takers’ health.

Biden’s answer may prompt more debate about the topic.

Over the last few months, pro-transgender groups have kept a low profile in the presidential campaign and in the debate over the Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett.

Biden’s answer prompted critics and praise on Twitter.

Joe Biden tonight said 7 and 8 year olds should be given the authority to be “transgender,” despite data proving that the vast majority of kids with gender confusion outgrow it by puberty. We’re talking life-altering, body-harming decisions made by 1st graders.
