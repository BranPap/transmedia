Daniel Radcliffe Defends Trashing J.K. Rowling for Opposing Transgender Radicalism: ‘Not Everybody in the Franchise’ Shares Her Beliefs

Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe has defended his decision to attack and throw author J.K. Rowling under the bus after she spoke out against transgender radicalism. In the summer of 2020, J.K. Rowling said that transgender ideology could lead to the erasure of womanhood as we know it by denying the basic biological functions that differentiate women from men.

The idea that women like me, who’ve been empathetic to trans people for decades, feeling kinship because they’re vulnerable in the same way as women – ie, to male violence – ‘hate’ trans people because they think sex is real and has lived consequences – is a nonsense.

Following her post, J.K. Rowling faced severe social media backlash as several stars from the Harry Potter franchise rebuked her stance, with Daniel Radcliffe proclaiming that “Transgender women are women” in a gushing letter on the Trevor Project’s website. Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Eddie Redmayne also publicly declared their support for the trans movement while only actors Ralph Fiennes, who played Voldemort, and Robbie Coltrane, who played Hagrid, came to Rowling’s defense.
