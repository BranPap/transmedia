Transgender Fashion Model Lands First Major Magazine Cover After Gender Surgery

Transgender fashion model Andreja Pejic has landed himself on the cover of a major fashion magazine and will adorn the March issue of Marie Claire Spain.

Born male as Andrej in Bosnia, Pejic had previously been designated an androgynous model; however, the 24-year-old underwent gender reassignment surgery in 2014, and he has been modeling as a female ever since.

The transgender model told the outlet in 2014, “I realized my past as an androgynous model doesn’t make me any less of a woman today … And I’m proud of it.”

Last February, Pejic appeared on a catwalk at London Fashion Week.
