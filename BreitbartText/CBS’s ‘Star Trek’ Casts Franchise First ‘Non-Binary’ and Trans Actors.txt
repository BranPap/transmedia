CBS’s ‘Star Trek’ Casts Franchise First ‘Non-Binary’ and Trans Actors

CBS’s Star Trek: Discovery has cast the franchise’s first-ever “non-binary” and transgender actors, Blu del Barrio and Ian Alexander, who will appear in season 3.

Adira “will find a new home on the U.S.S. Discovery and form an unexpected bond with Lt. Commander Paul Stamets (Anthony Rapp) and Dr. Hugh Culber (Wilson Cruz),” continues the statement, adding that “the first transgender character is Gray, portrayed by Ian Alexander.”

Co-showrunner and executive producer Michelle Paradise said that “Star Trek has always made a mission of giving visibility to underrepresented communities because it believes in showing people that a future without division on the basis of race, gender, gender identity or sexual orientation is entirely within our reach.”

“We take pride in working closely with Blu del Barrio, Ian Alexander, and Nick Adams at GLAAD to create the extraordinary characters of Adira and Gray, and bring their stories to life with empathy, understanding, empowerment and joy,” Paradise added.

The statement noted that both del Barrio and Alexander are a “non-binary” actors who use “they/them pronouns,” adding that Alexander uses “he/him pronouns” as well.

Of course, there’s been an explosion in recent years of trans and non-binary people attached to TV shows, like Showtime’s Billions, FX’s Pose, and Netflix’s Orange is the New Black.

The third season of Star Trek: Discovery is set to premiere on Thursday, October 15.
