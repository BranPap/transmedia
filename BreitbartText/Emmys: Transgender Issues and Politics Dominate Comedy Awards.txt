Emmys: Transgender Issues and Politics Dominate Comedy Awards

Transgender and political-themed TV shows were well-represented in the comedy awards category during Sunday’s 67th Primetime Emmy awards.

Amazon’s original family drama Transparent took home a Best Comedy Actor award, for Jeffrey Tambor’s portrayal of Maura Pfefferman, a transgendered woman.”I’d like to dedicate my performance and this award to the transgender community… Thanks for letting us be part of the change,” said Tambor during his speech.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus took home the top comedy actress award for her role in HBO’s political satire, Veep, in which Tony Hale also won for best supporting actor.

The Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series award also went to Veep, which was written by Simon Blackwell, Armando Lannucci, and Tony Roche.
