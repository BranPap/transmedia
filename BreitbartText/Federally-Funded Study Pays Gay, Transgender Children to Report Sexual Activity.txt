The NIH developed the app from 2012 to 2013 for $300,000 and has spent more than $7.9 million for researchers at Columbia to comb through the data since 2016.

According to the 2020 study published based on collected data, the app is was “designed to be specific to the risk contexts and realities of young sexual minority men, and to include psychoeducational and skill-building components with interactive games and activities.”

According to the Free Beacon, some health experts have ethics concerns considering that the young participants were “recruited” without parental permission.

Speaking with the outlet, former deputy assistant administrator in the Bureau for Global Health at the U.S. Agency for International Development Dr. Monique Wubbenhorst said, “There is an ethical balance between investigators’ desire to enroll children in a study and the need to support parents in caring for their children.”

“There are additional concerns that minor children in this study may be engaged in sexually exploitative relationships with older males, sex trafficking/child prostitution, violence, and sexual abuse, from which they should be protected,” she continued.

But some bioethics experts are surprised by the grant of the waiver, according to the Free Beacon.

Bioethics fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy center Dr. Aaron Rothstein told the outlet that he is surprised by the waiver given that the minor subjects were both paid and provided transportation to meetings without parental consent. Wubbenhorst pointed to research showing parents having a significant impact on reducing risky sexual activity among their children.

This year, the MyPEEPS study has received more federal funding –$340,000 — to focus on transgender teenagers.

According to the NIH, the proportion of gay men in the population is about two percent, but they also make up 56 percent of HIV cases.
