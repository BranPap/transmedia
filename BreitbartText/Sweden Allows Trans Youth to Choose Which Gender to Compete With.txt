Sweden Allows Trans Youth to Choose Which Gender to Compete With

The Swedish Athletics Association is looking to make sports in Sweden more inclusive for young transgendered individuals by making it easier for them to choose which gender they want to compete with.

“Regardless of which gender you were born in, you can compete in the girl or boy class you feel you belong to,” Thor told the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter.

According to Dagens Nyheter, the Swedish LGBT group RFSL looked at the experiences of 110 transgender people in sports and found that many felt excluded due to the existing gender division in sports.

“Society at large is not always adapted to the reality of transgender people and this is part of changing this, by making athletics as accessible as possible for everyone. We want everyone, based on their gender identity, to be able to participate in athletics,” Thor told the newspaper.

Last month in France, the French rugby federation announced it would be allowing trans athletes t compete, with Serge Simon, the vice-president of the French rugby federation, stating: “Rugby is an inclusive, sharing sport, without distinction of sex, gender, origin or religion.”

The move came after World Rugby gave a recommendation saying that transwomen should not play in elite-level women’s rugby for safety reasons in October of last year.

In the U.S., some states, such as Florida, have moved to pass laws to ban trans athletes in women’s sports under the guise of protecting girls’ and women’s sports.

“So what we’re really doing is protecting women against discrimination in athletic competition,” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis told Breitbart News, adding: “I think that’s something that’s really important — that we preserve the integrity and fairness of these girls’ and women’s sports.”
