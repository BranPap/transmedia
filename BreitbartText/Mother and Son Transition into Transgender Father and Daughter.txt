Mother and Son Transition into Transgender Father and Daughter

A transgender mother and son from Detroit are transitioning together to become father and daughter.

Now, the mother and son are transitioning from their biological sexes to the opposite sex together, the New York Post reported.

“I wanted to make my parents proud of who I am, but I thought that they would not like me,” Corey told 9 News about his decision to come out as transgender.

Eric Maison, who is a biological female who identifies as a male, was emboldened by Corey’s decision.

Eric said it was an emotional decision she had to make.

Eric, who used to go by Erica, underwent a double mastectomy and said she plans to stay with her husband Les, who supports the transition.

“I fell in love with the person. She was beautiful as a woman, but equally beautiful on the inside,” Les Maison said. “As long as Eric is happy with the appearance, Eric will be happy with what’s in her brain – or his brain.”

Eric says she has regretted that she did not come to terms with her gender identity sooner.

“The only regret I have is not being educated sooner about what transgenderism was, so I could do it sooner,” Eric Maison said.
