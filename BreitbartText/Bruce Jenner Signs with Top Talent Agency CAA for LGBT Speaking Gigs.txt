Bruce Jenner Signs with Top Talent Agency CAA for LGBT Speaking Gigs

Creative Artists Agency has signed Bruce Jenner to its public speakers department, where they will work with the former Olympian to create a platform to bring awareness to the transgender community.

According to The Wrap, the talent agency plans to identify and create opportunities for Jenner to share his transgender experience through speaking engagements and use his new clout to address issues within the LGBT community.

The agency did provide a disclaimer, saying it did not sign Jenner to its roster to represent him for TV and film roles, nor to exploit the publicity.

It was announced this week to heavy criticism online that the former Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year will be the recipient of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYS in July.
