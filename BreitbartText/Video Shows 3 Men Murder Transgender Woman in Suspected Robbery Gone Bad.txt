Video Shows 3 Men Murder Transgender Woman in Suspected Robbery Gone Bad



An auto body shop across the street from where the attack occurred caught the event on surveillance video that CBS Los Angeles obtained.

After being shot, the victim in the video stumbled further across the street and fell over. A bystander that stopped to help afterward was too late to save the victim.

Police report that the three alleged perpetrators are Hispanic men in their 20s, and the victim is described as a transgender woman in her 40s, according to the KCAL 9 report. The three men are reportedly still on the loose.

Some local individuals have left items and words in sidewalk chalk as a memorial to the victim. Los Angelesâ€™s LGBT Center was reportedly planning a vigil that was held Friday night.
