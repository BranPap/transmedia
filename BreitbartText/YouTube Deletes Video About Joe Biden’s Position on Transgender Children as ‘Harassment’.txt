YouTube Deletes Video About Joe Biden’s Position on Transgender Children as ‘Harassment’

Google-owned video platform YouTube has deleted a video that discusses Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s position on transgender children. According to YouTube, discussing the candidate’s position falls afoul of its policy against “harassment and cyberbullying.” The platform reinstated the video without explanation after YouTuber Benjamin Boyce appealed the decision.

Boyce’s tweet about the situation can be seen below, he has since uploaded the video to the independent video-sharing website BitChute:

A video where I argue against medically altering children to align with an identity was deleted by YouTube for "harassment and cyberbullying." It's now on bitchute, if you'd like to tell me what I did wrong (as YouTube likely will not):https://t.co/u008jAZqM7

Boyce has appealed YouTube’s removal of the video and posted a screenshot of an email in which it appears that YouTube has reinstated the video, but provided no context around the initial removal or why the video has been reinstated:

Boyce’s video is currently available for viewing:

YouTube’s policy on cyberbullying and harassment states that it removes any videos that include:

The policy considers insulting those under a “protected group status,” to be harassment, which YouTube states includes “insulting” anyone based on their “Gender Identity and Expression.”

Many Twitter users also reported receiving warning messages when attempting to visit Boyce’s video on BitChute from Twitter:

While Boyce’s video has been reinstated, it is worrying to see that even questioning a political candidate’s position on an issue such as the medical alteration of the gender of children can result in your voice being immediately silenced. Many that do not have an audience as Boyce does could find themselves unable to appeal such censorship.
