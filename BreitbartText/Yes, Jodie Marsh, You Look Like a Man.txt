Yes, Jodie Marsh, You Look Like a Man



Jodie Marsh isn’t a transgender icon: she just looks like one. When her career as a glamour model fizzled out, Marsh reinvented herself as an “extreme bodybuilder.” You know the type: a cartoonish figure tanned so dramatically that she basically looks like she’s ‘blacked up’. 

Let’s instead treat it as seriously as Marsh wants us to–and examine the facts. They are that Marsh has done grotesque things to her body and relentlessly publicised them via the press and social media. By anyone’s definition, she is ‘fair game’ for fair commentary.

Marsh is a businesswoman who is well aware of the power of personal branding. And she has recreated herself in the image of a Victorian circus performer… for what? Self esteem, perhaps. But more likely, attention and commercial advantage. 

She has profited from the freakish spectacle of dark brown body paint, fake boobs and gigantic biceps. Yet she’s incensed that someone might laugh at how undeniably peculiar she looks.

I mean, for Heaven’s sake, Jodie: the drag queen DJ Jodie Harsh who named herself after you looks more like a woman than you do these days.

If people want to turn their bodies into vehicles for public exhibitionism (is there a better way of describing the bizarre cult of bodybuilding?) they are perfectly entitled to do so. But they can’t cry foul when others react to their outrageous provocations.

I mean, it’s not like Marsh herself doesn’t know what she looks like. She certainly spends long enough each day in front of her front-facing (read: selfie) smartphone lens, tweeting pictures of her odd physique. 

Judging by the latest snaps, Marsh has spent hours enough in the gym to last a lifetime. Perhaps it is time, if I may be indelicate, to swap the dumbbells for the therapist’s couch, and to work out what drives a beautiful woman to turn herself into an object of pity and scorn.
