Jeffrey Tambor: ‘People’s Lives Depend’ on Transgender TV Show ‘Transparent’

Actor Jeffrey Tambor, who plays transgender woman Maura Pfefferman on Amazon’s Transparent, said he believes “people’s lives depend” on his award-winning show.

Tambor, 71, recalled the development of his character.

The actor added: “The world is changing, and for us to be part of it is everything I thought acting was … People’s lives depend on this. Lives are at stake. And that’s quite a mission.”

Tambor described himself as being left emotionally naked by the “huge responsibility” of the role. He also said that the production of season two, episode nine sometimes made him “throw-up nervous.”

Star Wars director J.J. Abrams moderated the discussion.

The Emmy and Golden Globe award-winning show is one of Amazon’s first original television series.

Tambor’s co-star, actress Melora Hardin, previously credited the show with the way people view and interact with the transgender community.

“I just feel so fortunate to be on a show that’s really changing, I think, the way people might interact with a trans person,” she said. “I certainly didn’t have trans people in my life before the show. I’d met some trans people, but I hadn’t had an opportunity to have relationships with them.”
