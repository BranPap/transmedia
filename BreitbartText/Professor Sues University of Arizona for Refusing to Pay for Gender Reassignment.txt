Professor Sues University of Arizona for Refusing to Pay for Gender Reassignment

The University of Arizona has spent more than $50,000 defending itself from a lawsuit filed by a professor who claims that she is entitled to gender reassignment surgery under the university healthcare plan.

The University of Arizona has spent $52,386.10 on a lawsuit against one of its own professors. Professor Russell Toomey, a female-to-male transgender person, claims that employees of the university are entitled to gender reassignment surgery under the university’s healthcare plan. The university and the state of Arizona say otherwise.

But it’s not that simple. The University of Arizona claims that it is limited by restrictions put into place by the Arizona Department of Administration. “Defendants have previously urged ADOA to remove the types of coverage exclusions requested by Plaintiff in the Complaint, but ADOA has not eliminated all exclusions,” attorneys for the University of Arizona wrote in court documents.

The case, which was highlighted this week by Campus Reform, could cost the University of Arizona thousands of dollars in additional legal fees.
