Transgender Patrons Banned from Bar Win $400,000 in Discrimination Case

On Wednesday, the Oregon Court of Appeals upheld a fine of $400,000 awarded to a group of transgender customers who were banned from a bar in Portland, Oregon.

Penalties were initially levied by the stateâ€™s Bureau of Labor and Industries in 2013 after the patrons filed a complaint in 2012 against Chris Penner, the owner of a bar called the P Club. One of the transgender patrons told the state that the bar owner left a message on his phone informing him that he and his group were no longer allowed to patronize the bar.

The group of transgender patrons belonged to a group they called the Rose City T-Girls.

The attorney defending the bar owner said his client had a right to safeguard his business.

The court, though, disagreed with the claims by the defense and ruled that the bar owner discriminated against the patrons on the basis of their sexual identities.
