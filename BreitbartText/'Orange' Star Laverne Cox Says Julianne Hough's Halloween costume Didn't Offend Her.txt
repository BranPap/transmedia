'Orange' Star Laverne Cox Says Julianne Hough's Halloween costume Didn't Offend Her

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 29 (UPI)–“Orange is the New Black” star Laverne Cox says she was not offended Julianne Hough darkened her skin when she dressed up as a character from the show.

The former “Dancing with the Stars” professional dancer was blasted for wearing black makeup to look like Crazy Eyes from the Netflix series “Orange is the New Black” at a Halloween party Oct. 25.

“I wasn’t offended,” Cox told UsMagazine.com. “I thought it was a shame that she is in this country, that she would wear black-face and not understand the historical implications of that. I don’t think Julianne is making a specific informed choice to comment on blackness. I just think it’s out of this ignorance. That’s really sad.”

Cox went on to say Hough was “obviously a fan of our show. I love Crazy Eyes, too.”

“I am a huge fan of the show Orange is the New Black, actress Uzo Aduba, and the character she has created,” Hough wrote. “It certainly was never my intention to be disrespectful or demeaning to anyone in any way. I realize my costume hurt and offended people and I truly apologize.”
