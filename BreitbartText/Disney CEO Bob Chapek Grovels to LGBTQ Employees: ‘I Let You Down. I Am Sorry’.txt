Disney CEO Bob Chapek Grovels to LGBTQ Employees: ‘I Let You Down. I Am Sorry’

The Walt Disney Co.’s CEO Bob Chapek has taken a knee before his LGBTQ employees, issuing a humiliating apology after some of them mutinied over the company’s refusal to condemn Florida’s Parental Rights in Education bill, which would forbid the teaching of sexuality and transgender ideology to students in kindergarten through third grade.

“You needed me to be a stronger ally in the fight for equal rights and I let you down. I am sorry,” Chapek said in a memo to Disney staffers that was obtained by multiple news outlets.

Bob Chapek said Disney will be contributing money to efforts to defeat similar legislation in other states. He also reiterated the company’s intention to “pause” political donations in Florida.

“When you have companies that have made a fortune off being family-friendly and catering to families and young kids, they should understand that parents of young kids do not want this injected into their kid’s kindergarten classroom,” he said.

Florida’s Senate passed the Parental Rights in Education bill earlier this week, clearing the way for DeSantis to sign it into law.
