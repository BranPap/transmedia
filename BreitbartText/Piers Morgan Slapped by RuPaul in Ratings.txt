Piers Morgan Slapped by RuPaul in Ratings



RuPaul, whose real name is RuPaul Andre Charles, is a famous drag queen and recently started season five of his show RuPaul’s Drag Race on cable network Logo TV.

Interestingly, RuPaul’s antics apparently drew more viewers than CNN’s Morgan did during the rating period for Monday, January 28.

The Logo TV network gears its programming to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community and is said to appear in only 41 million American homes. By contrast, CNN counts an audience of over 100 million U.S. homes, not to mention more than 890,000 American hotel rooms and airport terminal screens from coast to coast.
