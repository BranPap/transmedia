In 2016, Ashely became a principal cast member in the Oxygen reality series Strut, which followed the lives of a group of trans models.

As Breitbart News reported, Taylor Swift has embraced left-wing politics and woke-ism in recent years. In 2020, she officially endorsed Joe Biden’s bid for the White House, placing her enormous star power and influencer status in service of the Democratic presidential ticket. At the time, Swift said abortion and gay rights were among her top issues in choosing a candidate.

During the 2020 presidential race, Swift lashed out at then-President Donald Trump on social media. In one rant, she accused him of “stoking the fires of white supremacy,” warning “we will vote you out in November.”
