Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick to Disney: I will Make a Version of Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Law a ‘Top Priority’ for Texas

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) said he wants to pass a law similar to Florida’s Parental Rights in Education, saying such a bill would be a “top priority” for him in the Texas legislature’s upcoming session.

“At first, I was angry at their over-the-top radical resistance,” he said in a re-election campaign e-mail message that was also posted to his campaign’s website. “I will make this law a top priority in the next session. This issue will be addressed in our interim Education Committee hearings under Parental Rights.”

Florida’s law prevents the teaching of sexual orientation and gender ideology to children in kindergarten through third grade. Democrats and the corporate news media have sought to smear it as the “Don’t Say Gay” law, even though the text makes no mention of homosexuality.

Disney executives have promised to fight similar laws around the country as part of the company’s new commitment to supporting radical LGBTQ activism.

Texas would become the seventh state to do so if state Republican lawmakers introduce a bill.

As Breitbart News reported, Patrick is urging Texas parents to stop patronizing Disney.

“Until they change their corporate philosophy, stop spending money with them,” he said. “Cut off the Disney Channel. Cancel your park trip or your cruise if one is planned. If you own Disney stock, sell it. Although I did not own many shares of individual Disney stock, I sold them today.”
