Video: Demi Lovato Comes Out as ‘Non-Binary,’ Uses ‘They / Them’ Pronouns

Pop superstar Demi Lovato, just months after coming out as “pansexual,” has announced that she is officially gender “non-binary” and will be using the pronouns “they” and “them” to refer to herself.

Demi Lovato made the revelation in an Instagram post on Wednesday. “I am proud to let you know that I identify as non-binary and will officially be changing my pronouns to they/them moving forward,” Lovato wrote. “This has come after a lot of healing and self-reflective work. I’m still learning and coming into myself, and I don’t claim to be an expert or a spokesperson.”

In a video accompanying the post, Lovato said her new gender identification “best represents the fluidity I feel in my gender expression” and allows her to feel more “authentic” and “true to the person I both know I am and am still discovering.”

Lovato sported the unisex haircut that she recently explained has allowed her to free herself “of the gender and sexuality norms” she says were placed on her “as a Christian in the South.”

As Breitbart News reported, Lovato came out as “pansexual” during an appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience.”
