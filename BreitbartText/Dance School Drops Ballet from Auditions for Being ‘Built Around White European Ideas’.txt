Dance School Drops Ballet from Auditions for Being ‘Built Around White European Ideas’

Britain’s Northern School of Contemporary Dance (NSCD) because it is “built around white European ideas” and is too “gendered”.

“It is essentially an elitist form. Young people need to pay to take ballet classes as a general rule and for a vast number of potential students, they’ve not had access to ballet,” explained the head of undergraduate studies at the dance school, Francesca McCarthy, in comments to the notionally right-leaning newspaper.

“There are issues relating to body, money, language and movement vocabulary.”

McCarthy also complained that ballet “has strongly gendered roots in terms of the movement vocabulary,” referencing the fact that “most of [the NSCD’s] ballet staff were trained at a time where divisions in the teaching of ballet were clear and men lifted women.”

Gendered language in ballet is also supposed to be an issue, with The Telegraph noting concerns about the fact that there is a clear division between female ballerinas and male danseurs in ballet.

Implicit gender roles and gendered language is evidently a matter of great concern to the NSCD, with McCarthy saying that the use of gender-neutral terms like “dancers/people/folk/everyone/everybody” are encouraged and efforts made to “try and embed the use of they in terms of pronouns in order to not make assumptions about a dancer’s identity”.

Woke language policing like this is endemic in British educational institutions, with Breitbart London reporting just days ago on the far from unique case of the University of Bristol banning “gendered” and “age-related” terms that could cause offence, such as “mankind” and “baby boomer”.
