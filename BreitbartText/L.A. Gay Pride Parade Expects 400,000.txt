L.A. Gay Pride Parade Expects 400,000

Close to 400,000 people are expected to show up on Sunday for the annual L.A. Pride Parade, celebrating the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, according to CBS Los Angeles.

The parade will begin at 11 am. A traditional moment of silence will be held at noon to honor the memories of members of the community who were killed in hate crimes, CBS notes.

Singer Demi Lovato has been selected as the parade’s grand marshal, and Mayor Eric Garcetti will be among those in attendance. Couples Paul Katami and partner Jeff Zarrillo and Kris Perry and partner Sandy Stier will serve as the community grand marshal, according to CBS. The couples were the plaintiffs involved in the lawsuit that led to the overturn of California’s ban on same-sex marriage.

The parade will travel west on Santa Monica Boulevard and end on Robertson Boulevard. Due to heavy traffic and road closures, the parade will be providing a free shuttle service called the Pride Ride to interested participants.

— San Vicente Blvd. will be closed between Santa Monica Blvd. and Melrose Ave from 7 p.m. Thursday to 10 a.m. Monday

— Santa Monica Blvd. will be closed between Fairfax Ave and Doheny Drive from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday

— Streets one block north and south of Santa Monica Blvd. will be closed between Fairfax Ave and La Peer Drive from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday
