Ellen DeGeneres: Transgender Stingray in Disney’s ‘Finding Dory’

Disney/Pixar’s upcoming film Finding Dory features a transgender stingray who transitions to become “Sting-Rhonda,” the film’s star Ellen DeGeneres revealed in an interview.

“There’s a stingray that’s becoming sting-Rhonda, so there’s a trans sting in the movie,” DeGeneres said.

In May, eagle-eyed viewers of the Finding Dory trailer speculated that the film would be the first Disney project to feature a lesbian couple, after a blink-and-you’ll-miss it shot of what appeared to be two women walking near a baby stroller.



The creative team behind the film have not confirmed or denied whether the couple is, in fact, lesbian, and DeGeneres also remained mum on the subject in her interview with USA Today.

Some fans of other Disney film properties have lobbied the studio to include LGBT characters in its films.

Two social media campaigns launched on Twitter last month included a petition to introduce a female love interest for Frozen princess Elsa and a petition to introduce a male love interest for Captain America, with fans using the hashtags #GiveElsaAGirlfriend and #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend, respectively.

There is some recent precedent for gay Disney characters; earlier this year, an episode of ABC’s fairy-tale drama Once Upon a Time featured a  lesbian true love’s kiss between Ruby and the Wizard of Oz’s Dorothy.
