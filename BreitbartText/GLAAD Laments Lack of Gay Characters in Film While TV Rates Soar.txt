GLAAD Laments Lack of Gay Characters in Film While TV Rates Soar

Television shows like Modern Family, which feature a gay couple with an adopted child, represent a rising wave of content with same-sex stories.

The same doesn’t hold true for feature films, according to GLAAD.

GLAAD staffers reviewed the 101 films released by 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures, Sony’s Columbia, Universal Pictures, Walt Disney Studios and Warner Bros.for the presence of LGBT characters and content.The organization, formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, found that only 14 movies featured characters identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual, and none included transgender characters. Just four pictures included LGBT characters that GLAAD determined had substantial roles in the film’s plot….

All six studios declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.

Cloud Atlas, a big-budget fantasy film starring Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, was deemed the most LGBT-friendly feature on 2012.
