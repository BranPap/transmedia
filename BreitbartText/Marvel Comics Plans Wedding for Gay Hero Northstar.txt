Marvel Comics Plans Wedding for Gay Hero Northstar

By MATT MOOREAssociated PressPHILADELPHIAWedding bells will ring this summer for Marvel Comics’ first openly gay hero, super speedster Northstar, and his longtime boyfriend.

Northstar revealed he was gay in the pages of “Alpha Flight” No. 106 in 1992, one of Marvel Entertainment’s first characters to do so.

Ten years later, in 2002, gay characters Apollo and the Midnighter were married in the pages of “The Authority” published by DC’s Wildstorm imprint.

Comics, as a medium, have embraced gay, lesbian and transgender characters, including the introduction of Kevin Keller by Archie Comics. Comic strips have done likewise.

This month, cartoonist Tom Batiuk is writing about a gay couple trying to attend their high school prom in “Funky Winkerbean,” a move that has divided the fictional community.

For Marvel, the upcoming wedding is a way to further embed same-sex issues in its contemporary universe.

Author Marjorie Liu, who is writing “Astonishing X-Men,” said the decision to have the pair marry was appropriate.
