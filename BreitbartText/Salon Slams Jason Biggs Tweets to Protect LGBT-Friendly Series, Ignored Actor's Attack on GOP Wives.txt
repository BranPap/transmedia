Salon Slams Jason Biggs Tweets to Protect LGBT-Friendly Series, Ignored Actor's Attack on GOP Wives

Salon.com is speaking out about Jason Biggs’ crude Twitter account. Why now?

The American Pie star is notorious for his R-rated social media messages. Yet Salon.com scribe Daniel D’Addario is suddenly furious about Biggs’ Twitter jokes. What changed?

Yet Salon kept calm when Biggs launched a series of vulgar attacks on the wives of the GOP presidential ticket back in 2012. The outlet ran two articles on the subject at the time–both straight news items revealing how Biggs used extreme sexual comments against both Janna Ryan and Ann Romney.

That didn’t raise any alarms over at Salon.com, even if the women in question weren’t even involved in politics directly.
