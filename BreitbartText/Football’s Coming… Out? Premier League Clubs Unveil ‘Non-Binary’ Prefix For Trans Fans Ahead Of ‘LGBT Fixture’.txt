Football’s Coming… Out? Premier League Clubs Unveil ‘Non-Binary’ Prefix For Trans Fans Ahead Of ‘LGBT Fixture’

Swansea and Bournemouth will be the first top-flight football clubs to offer the non-binary prefix ‘Mx’, they announced to fans as UK sports gear up for an unprecedented LGBT campaign.

“As a club, we’re continually looking at ways to make our services more inclusive,” said Swansea equality and diversity manager Lucy Norman of the trans-friendly title, which will be rolled out across major points of service at the club.

She added: “Language plays a really important part in delivering this and ensuring that everyone feels welcome — regardless of age, gender or gender identity, sexuality, or ethnicity.”

Congratulations, Swansea fans – you're no longer male or female! https://t.co/Eud7Q1c5Xa

“Thank god I won’t be there tomorrow, the club prefers us to educate our kids in gender fluidity instead of good football,” wrote ‘sammylee3’ in a post calling the club “a complete and utter joke.”

However, there were also messages of support, including, “Excellent. Well done the club for a change”, from some forums posters, who attacked those who disparaged the club’s wholehearted embrace of LGBT activism as “Daily Mail readers”.

The announcement came ahead of LGBT pressure group Stonewall’s “Rainbow Laces” campaign, which runs between November 24 and December 3, in which sporting bodies across the UK “come out for equality” by promoting LGBT lifestyles.

All 92 football league clubs are supporting the campaign and will carry Stonewall adverts in matchday programmes, while players don actual rainbow laces in their shoes at games taking place over the ten days, with team captains wearing rainbow armbands.

In addition, matches will feature rainbow-coloured pitch flags, a rainbow ball plinth, and timing boards will similarly be decorated with pro-LGBT branding.

British Basketball players will be training with rainbow-coloured balls over the course of the initiative, while in the world of UK hockey, Cardiff Devils will play in an entire kit designed to celebrate gay pride.

But UKIP Education Spokesman David Kurten warned the campaign is symptomatic of a worrying trend in Britain, telling Breitbart London that: “No area of society seems to be immune to the push by militant transgender activists and the equality and diversity industry to deconstruct and dissolve the scientific fact that there are two biological sexes: male and female.

“Most people are asking: ‘where will this end?’ The truth is that ‘progressivism’ will never end until cultural Marxism has swept away family, nation, Christianity, male, female, and everything which gives people identity.”
