Transgender Teen Jazz Jennings Scores Skincare Campaign

Transgender teenager and activist Jazz Jennings inked a deal with Johnson & Johnson this week to be one of the new faces of its #SeeTheRealMe campaign for Clean & Clear skincare products.

The 14-year-old, who recently landed her own reality television series at TLC, joins other teenagers in the company’s social media campaign designed to promote natural beauty.

“The real me is happy and proud to be who I am. And I’m just having fun being one of the girls,” Jennings concludes.

“I feel really honored to be part of the #SeeTheRealMe campaign,” the teen told Huffington Post. “It’s really amazing, as it helps many teen girls who are struggling. It helps them to find themselves and be true to who they are. I hope they can learn to be brave and not care what other people think about them, because if they just stay positive and spread love, then others will be true friends who will accept them no matter what.”

Jennings, who was reportedly diagnosed with gender dysphoria at the age of 5, has also written a children’s book, titled I Am Jazz. She landed on Time magazine’s “25 Most Influential Teens of 2014” list.
