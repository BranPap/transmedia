Bruce Jenner to Become a Woman, Document Transition on TV

Long before reality television, Bruce Jenner was an American icon after his performance at the 1976 summer Olympics catapulted him to superstardom. Now, the former AP Male Athlete of the Year is reportedly ready to officially announce he is transitioning into a woman.

Jenner’s changing appearance has been well documented by photographs and rumors, but now speculation appears to be confirmed. A source close to the Jenner family told People Magazine Friday, “Bruce is transitioning to a woman.”

Not to be outdone by the Kardashians, Bruce is said to be filming his transition and will release a docu-series about his new life some time this year when he is “comfortable.”

“He’s being very smart about and also respectful about his transition,” the insider told People. “Instead of completely shocking everyone, his changes have been subtle, and his family has had the chance to slowly get used to his new looks and life.”

The insider finished, “He’s so happy and excited. He gets to lay down a huge bag of bricks. He’s been through a dark period and is coming out on the other side.”
