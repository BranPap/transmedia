Schoolgirl ‘Self-Harmed’ After Being Hounded Out of School by Pro-Trans Bullies

A schoolgirl who was hounded out of her school by pro-transgender bullies over her political views claims that she was driven to “self-harm” by the incident.

Having initially come to light last month, the allegations that the schoolgirl was hounded out of school last year for questioning transgender ideology took the British political sphere by storm, with well-known names coming out in defence of the girl, while other leftist activists heaped doubt as to whether the reports on the allegations were presenting the full story.

However, in an interview published by UnHerd on Tuesday, the girl at the centre of the controversy reiterated her telling of events, while also alleging that the bullying drove her to self-harm within the premises of the school.

What’s more, the girl claims that the school did very little to help her situation, isolating her from her fellow pupils and allegedly labelling her as someone with a history of provocation.

Eventually, she left the school, claiming she was unable to put up with the harassment any longer.

I need your help!

This "story" – claiming 60 girls drove a girl out of a school for "questioning trans ideology" – doesn't include their side of the story or even name the school.

The young woman — now 19 years of age and contemplating going to college — also took aim at leftist talking head Owen Jones, who posted online in response to a report on her story that he wanted to speak “anonymously” to the pro-transgender girls who are alleged to have bullied her out of the school.

“He seemed convinced it was just a case of high school bullying that was contrived by a bigot to victimise herself.”

While the allegedly bullied girl has perceived the reactions of some in the British media as being rather hostile to her story, other big names came out to voice their support for her, including Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling —  a vocal critic of militant transgenderism.

“Utterly shameful,” the prolific writer said in a social media post sharing the story of the girl’s bullying.

“The girl’s crime? Saying ‘sex exists.'”
