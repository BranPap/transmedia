Russians Detain Transgender Communist Shouting 'Gay Is OK' at Olympics

Fans went to a gay-rights protest Monday night and a hockey game broke out. 

Authorities in Sochi detained a former Italian legislator protesting at the Olympic Games for homosexual and transgender rights on Monday. Police removed Vladimir Luxuria, a man who dresses as a woman, from Shayba Arena after the flamboyantly dressed former parliamentarian shouted pro-gay slogans. Luxuria, well known to Italians as a television personality, won a seat in the Italian chamber of deputies as a member of the Communist Refoundation Party in 2006 only to lose it in the 2008 elections. 

Russia’s law prohibiting the “propaganda of homosexualism among minors” has been criticized by gay activists and the president of the United States, who sent several prominent gay athletes to Sochi in his stead.
