‘I Am Cait’ Ratings Nosedive: Trans Jenner Loses Most of Audience with Season 2 Premiere

I Am Cait, the E! docu-series that chronicles Bruce “Caitlyn” Jenner’s transition from a man to a woman, has lost almost two-thirds of its first season audience.

The highly anticipated show debuted last July to an audience of 2.7 million; however, a steady decline in overall viewers saw the premiere season end with an audience of roughly 1.3 million.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Sunday’s episode brought in only 745,000 viewers and a 0.3 rating among adults 18-49, for a total loss of roughly 2 million viewers from last season.

I Am Cait’s eight-episode first season averaged 2.2 million viewers and a 1.0 rating among adults 18-49, when including live-plus-seven-day ratings.

After expressing support for Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz last week, Jenner was excoriated by scores of angry trans and LGBT activists online.

In an interview with The Advocate on Wednesday, Mar. 2, Jenner praised Cruz for being a “great constitutionalist” and expressed interest in becoming the Texas Senator’s “trans ambassador,” should he become president.

Trans activists on Reddit and Twitter immediately disavowed Jenner, with one opining, “There isn’t a single candidate in this election more anti-trans than Ted Cruz.”
