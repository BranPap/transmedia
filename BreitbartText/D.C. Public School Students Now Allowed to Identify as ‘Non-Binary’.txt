D.C. Public School Students Now Allowed to Identify as ‘Non-Binary’

Public school students in Washington D.C. are now allowed to identify as “non-binary” instead of male or female, according to a report.

A report from the Washington Post claims that a new policy will allow public school students in Washington D.C. to identify as “non-binary.” The term refers to the theory that gender exists on a spectrum. “Non-binary” individuals claim that their gender exists outside of the traditional “male” and “female” categories.
