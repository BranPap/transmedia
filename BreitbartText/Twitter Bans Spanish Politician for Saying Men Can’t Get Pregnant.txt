Twitter Bans Spanish Politician for Saying Men Can’t Get Pregnant

Twitter refused to comment on its 12-hour ban of the Spanish politician Francisco José Contrera, deputy leader of Vox, the leading populist conservative party in the country. Why did Twitter ban Contrera? Because he said men can’t become pregnant.

In the tweet that got him suspended, Contrera said “a man cannot get pregnant. A man has no uterus or eggs.”

In a post on Facebook, Contrera condemned Twitter as “fascist” for its suppression of his speech.

“I’ve been blocked from Twitter for 12 hours for ‘hate speech,’ said the Spanish politician. “The hateful tweet (which I was forced to delete) was one that said: ‘A man cannot get pregnant. A man has no womb or eggs.’ You can see this is already fascist biology. Next time I’ll try 2 + 2 = 4.”

It also suspended the account of Lauren Witzke, who ran for the U.S. Senate in Delaware last year as the Republican candidate, after she condemned a comment from a “gender nonconforming” left-wing activist, Alok Vaid-Menon, who appeared to defend the sexualization of minors. Witzke condemned the comment as “demonic.”

Breitbart News reached out to Twitter so the company could explain its decision, but it refused to comment.
