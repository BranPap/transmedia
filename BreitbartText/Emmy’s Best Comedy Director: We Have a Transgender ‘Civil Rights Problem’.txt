Emmy’s Best Comedy Director: We Have a Transgender ‘Civil Rights Problem’

Transparent creator Jill Soloway won her first Emmy Sunday night in the Best Directing – Comedy Series category for her transgender-themed hit Amazon dramedy.

“Thank you God-dess… I promised the goddess I would thank her,” Soloway began her acceptance speech.

“Something interesting about my mapa – she could tomorrow go and try to find an apartment and in 32 states it would be legal for the landlord to look her in the eye and say, ‘We don’t rent to trans people.'” Soloway said.

“We don’t have a trans tipping point yet, we have a trans civil rights problem,” Soloway continued, directing viewers to visit the website for the National Center for Transgender Equality.

Soloway also singled out Transparent‘s lead actor Jeffrey Tambor for “channeling Maura” Pfefferman, the transgender parent of three the actor plays on the critically-acclaimed Amazon show. Tambor would go on to win Best Actor in a Comedy Series shortly after Soloway left the stage.

Tambor dedicated his own award to the transgender community at large.

“Thank you for your patience, thank you for your stories, thank you for your inspiration. Thank you for letting us be part of the change,” Tambor said.

Transparent took home the Golden Globe for Best Television Series – Comedy or Musical earlier this year. Tambor also won a Golden Globe for his acting on the show.
