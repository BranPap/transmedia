New Hampshire Voters Pick ‘Transsexual Satanist Anarchist’ for GOP Sheriff Nominee

A biological man who describes himself as a “transsexual Satanist anarchist” and whose campaign slogan running for sheriff in Cheshire County, New Hampshire, was “f—k the police” has won the Republican nomination for that post. 

@Aria_DiMezzo won the republican nomination for sheriff w/o party support using "fuck the police" as her campaign slogan. Soup for the whole family.#DiMezzo4Sheriff⠀ ⠀   　🍲 🍲 🍲  🍲   🍲   🍲👇  🍲 🍲 👇  　🍲   🍲 　  🍲    🍲 　  👢     👢https://t.co/MoiO4KT9Yi

The Post said DiMezzo goes by the title “High Priestess of the Reformed Satanic Church.”

DiMezzo’s Twitter account says he is #Godless and #Lawless.

'It has been brought to my attention that the Cheshire County Republican Committee is organizing a write-in campaign against me. Many advocate voting for the Democrat over voting for me. Why are they so scared of freedom?' https://t.co/xkp6Turgsv pic.twitter.com/2LhUUrm0wR
