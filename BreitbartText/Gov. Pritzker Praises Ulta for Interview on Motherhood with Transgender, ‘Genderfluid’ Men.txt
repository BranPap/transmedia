Gov. Pritzker Praises Ulta for Interview on Motherhood with Transgender, ‘Genderfluid’ Men

Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker says he is proud that a corporate advertising campaign is touting a man who claims to be a woman.

“I know I can find love. I know I can still be a performer. I know I can have a family. I want to be a mom one day — and I absolutely can! The narrative still has a long way to go,” Mulvaney stated.

While the company faced severe backlash on social media for excluding women from a conversation about women, Gov. J.B. Pritzker voiced his support for Ulta Beauty’s interview. 

Proud of Illinois-based @Ultabeauty for making inclusivity part of their brand. Dylan has inspired millions around the world with her openness and positivity. Hate has no home in Illinois and we will protect our trans and non-binary community. https://t.co/JeVD2BCACY
