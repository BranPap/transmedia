Transgender Woman to Join Cast of ‘Real Housewives of Atlanta’

What do you do if the biggest star of your reality TV show suddenly bolts for greener pastures? If you’re the Bravo network, get in line with industry trends and replace her with a transgender personality.

Well before Bruce Jenner’s official gender transition, and subsequent reality TV docu-series “I Am Cait,” transgender TV shows and characters began popping up all over television, including shows on ABC Family, CBS, FOX, and TLC, as well as on streaming platforms Netflix (“Orange is the New Black”), and Amazon (“Transparent”).

Following the exit of NeNe Leaks from the Bravo reality series “The Real Housewives of Atlanta,” the network has reportedly been eying 27-year-old transgender model Amiyah Scott, who was born Arthur.

TheWrap has confirmed through a source that Scott is slated take over for Leaks, who was the show’s last original cast member, for the upcoming 8th season.

A big star on Instagram, with nearly 700,000 followers, Scott describes himself as “the unicorn with an invisible horn,” as well as a model, makeup guru, weaveologist, and beauty consultant on his Model Mayhem page.

The New Orleans, LA-based personality also says, “..I have been faced with many of “Life’s” obstacles, I’ve overcome them all and have become a better person because of them.”

Adding: “When I stand before God, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left, and could say, “I used everything you gave me.”

Arthur began his transition to Amiyah at age 17, and has been romantically linked to a number of high profile rappers and other stars.
