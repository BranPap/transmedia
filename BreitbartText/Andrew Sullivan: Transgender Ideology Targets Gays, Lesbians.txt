Andrew Sullivan: Transgender Ideology Targets Gays, Lesbians

Transgender activists are increasingly smearing gays and lesbians as ‘transphobic,’ says Andrew Sullivan, the partway conservative gay author at New York Magazine.

“Sexual genital preference [i.e homosexuality and heterosexuality] immoral.” Saying the quiet part out loud. Critical gender theory is homophobic. https://t.co/rHv9ZU3i33

Aims of the LGB Alliance

Lesbians groups say their members increasingly find themselves being pressured to accept sex with self-declared “women” who have male sex organs and who describe themselves as lesbians. Many anecdotes of sexual pressure are provided in a survey report by an U.K.-based lesbian group, Get The L Out:

[Lesbian] women who were in groups that were not “women-only” reported “feeling silenced”, “intimidated”, “unable to speak freely”, “uncomfortable” with the group policy and wishing the group was for women only but “dare not say it”. Several reported how “transwomen derail” and monopolise the discussion to be solely about their issues while shutting down discussion about women’s or lesbians’ issues by calling it “transphobic”. Group dynamics are described as “toxic”. Several women explain how “transwomen are behaving just like men”. Lesbians constantly report being told their sexuality is “wrong” if they openly state they are solely attracted to women. Women reported “threats”, “intimidations” and “abuse”, by “transwomen” and allies.

…

50 percent of the respondents reported being pressured or coerced to accept a transwoman as a sexual partner. Much of this pressure happens online. Lesbians are routinely harassed for stating that their sexuality excludes males regardless of their “gender identity”. Most respondents reported being subjected to such rhetoric directly or indirectly, and have experienced it as a form of “psychological coercion” with the general feeling that it is “online everywhere” and “relentless”.

…

Many lesbians reveal leading a double life where their lesbianism is toned down. Many have no social life or meet underground and explain how difficult and dangerous it has become to meet other lesbians. Lesbian dating sites are infiltrated by men who pose as lesbians (whether they identify as transwoman or not and whether they “pass” as women or not), leading many lesbians to feel unsafe at the thought of unknowingly going on a date with a man. Both in groups and dating sites, the presence of men who identify as transwomen acts as a threat, leading to self-policing and silencing.

Time Mag. endorses transgender activist who claimed that 'women' can have male sexual organs. Hmm. Does that mean progressives get to label lesbians as 'bigots' if they won't date biological men who claim they are living as women? https://t.co/BfuvY5w1xP

This demand often comes as an objection to the so-called “cotton ceiling,” which describes how women will deny sex to the transgender men while agreeing to treat them in as women in public. This “cotton ceiling” fight is sharpest among lesbians, who are being pressured by transgender men to validate the men’s claims to be women by agreeing to sleep with them.



The lesbian scene is colonised by them now. We cannot escape them. They disrespect our boundaries and threaten us if we don’t have sex with them #cottonceiling. https://t.co/qPBHpaGkOm

Option B: The concept of “bigotry” creeps so far from the traditional definition that it becomes utterly meaningless and loses all power, which will be very convenient for actual bigots. https://t.co/lP3BGMrGUT

Trans ideology is homophobic. Young lesbians are being told they are bigots if they won't have sex with men who claim to be women. They are being told they are transphobic for not wanting penises in their sex life. Google #CottonCeiling pic.twitter.com/UMSlSfApoJ

I support @AllianceLGB because they have the courage to call out pseudo-scientific nonsense.

There are two *sexes* (M&F), and ~7 billion different personalities. Teaching kids they have to identify into one of "over 100" gender identities is harmful, restrictive & regressive. https://t.co/0OVeXxJIaJ
