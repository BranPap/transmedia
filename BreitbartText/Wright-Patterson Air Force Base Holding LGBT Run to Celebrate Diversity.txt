Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Holding LGBT Run to Celebrate Diversity

On July 16, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base—Ohio’s largest military base—will be “holding a lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender run” to celebrate diversity.

The move is part of a “diversity and inclusion initiative” put forth by the Department of Defense (DOD).

Wright-Patterson AFB put out a release saying the “5K Diversity Color Run on Thursday is open to everyone and will cost participants $10 each.” They are asking participants to wear white shirts.

The original race announcement, posted to Facebook in June, says, “Wear white and let your colors shine through!”
