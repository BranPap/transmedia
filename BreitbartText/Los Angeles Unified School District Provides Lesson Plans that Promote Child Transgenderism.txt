Los Angeles Unified School District Provides Lesson Plans that Promote Child Transgenderism

America’s second-largest school district is teaming up with various left-wing organizations to promote child transgenderism.

Open Books, previously named Gender Nation, is an organization that aims to “validate children with LGBTQ+ storytelling” by furnishing public schools with books that endorse child transgenderism. The LAUSD Human Relations, Diversity and Equity website explains that the district received “an enormous donation of LGBTQIA-themed books that are developmentally appropriate for elementary and span schools” from the organization.

The document articulates that teachers who read the book to their students should attempt “to increase student understanding of ally behavior” and “To expand students’ perceptions and understandings of gender,” adding that “students will learn important vocabulary related to gender.”

The guide even tells teachers to “Avoid introducing it as a book about a transgender girl. Instead, you could simply say that this is a story based on the real-life experiences of a girl named Jazz.” It also provides sample discussion questions, including “In the book, Jazz says that she is transgender. Who can describe what transgender means?”

Another one of the 16 books that the district promotes is “When Aidan Became a Brother,” which is intended for children as young as five years old and also follows a child who wants to change her sex. The book follows along as she attempts to change her sex and prepares to present herself as a boy

The guide even asks, “Have you ever asked about the gender of a baby before the baby was born? After reading the book, do you think about that differently? Please explain.”

The guide also tells teachers “You can explain that when Aidan was born, his parents and the doctors thought he was a girl—but Aidan knew he was a boy.” The ADL’s Education Department previously named “When Aidan Became a Brother” their book of the month.

It was previously revealed that the LAUSD hosted a nurse from the Children Hospital LA’s Trans Youth Health and Development Department to provide information on “medical transition and gender care” and maintains a “Queer All School Year” calendar that encourages left-wing activism.

The LAUSD did not respond to a request for comment.
