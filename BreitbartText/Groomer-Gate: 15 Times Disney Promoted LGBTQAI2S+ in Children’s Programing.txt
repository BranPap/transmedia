Groomer-Gate: 15 Times Disney Promoted LGBTQAI2S+ in Children’s Programing

Anyone who has been paying attention to the Walt Disney Co. in recent years knows that the studio has made no secret about incorporating gay and transgender messaging into its content aimed at children.

Disney CEO Bob Chapek recently vowed to continue fighting Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law, as well as similar legislation in other states. The Florida law prohibits the teaching of sexuality and gender ideology to kids in kindergarten through third grade.

Recently leaked internal videos show Disney creatives openly discussing their plans for more gay and transgender characters.

1. Disney+ hosts LGBTQ Pride concert with drag and gender non-binary performers

Last year, Disney+ hosted This Is Me: Pride Celebration Spectacular, a musical special on YouTube starring drag queen Nina West, with performances of popular Disney songs re-imagined with LGBTQ themes. Among the performers were gender-fluid singer Alex Newell and gender non-binary performer Jesse James Keitel.

3. Pixar looking for minors to cast as “14-year-old transgender girl”

8. Disney’s Jungle Cruise (2021) features gay coming-out scene, sort of.

The studio’s live-action movie, based on the enduring theme park ride, featured a main character who is gay — MacGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall), the brother of Emily Blunt’s protagonist. In one scene, he comes out of the closet — sort of — by explaining that he will never get married because his “interests lie elsewhere.”

9. Pixar’s Onward (2020) features lesbian character

The animated movie features a lesbian character — a Cyclops police officer named Officer Spector, voiced by openly gay actress Lena Waithe. “It just kind of happened,” the film’s producer, Kori Rae, told Yahoo Entertainment. “The scene, when we wrote it, was kind of fitting and it opens up the world a little bit, and that’s what we wanted.”



10. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019) climaxes with lesbian kiss

The final installment in Disney’s Star Wars trilogy culminated with a lesbian kiss between Commander Larma D’Acy (Amanda Lawrence) and pilot Wrobie Tyce (Vinette Robinson) after the Resistance defeated the First Order.

As Breitbart News reported, Disney censored the scene in Singapore in compliance with the country’s rules around LGBTQ content.



11. Disney Channel’s Andi Mack series features gay teen kiss

The coming-of-age drama series featured the network’s first gay teenage couple in the series finale that aired in 2019.  The episode saw 13-year-old Cyrus Goodman confess his feelings for his classmate, TJ Kippen, who appeared to feel the same way.

“Is there anything else you want to tell me?” Cyrus asks. “Yeah,” TJ says, before asking him the same question..

“Yes,” Cyrus responds, as TJ holds his hand before the camera pans away from the romantic fire-lit scene.



12. Disney+’s Big Shots features lesbian teen kiss 

The family drama series featured a lesbian kiss between teenagers in an episode that aired last year. In the episode, Carolyn — also known as “Mouse” in the series —  plays a song that she wrote for her female friend Harper, leading the two teens to begin smooching.

13. Beauty and the Beast (2017) turned Le Fou (Josh Gad) gay

Disney’s live-action remake features actor Josh Gad in the role of Le Fou. In an interview, director Bill Condon revealed that Le Fou is gay, though the character never says so explicitly.  (The character wasn’t gay in the original 1991 animated movie.) “I think it’s great. I think Disney has always been on the forefront there,” he said.



14/15. Disney Channel’s Good Luck Charlie and Disney Junior’s Doc McStuffins feature lesbian moms

The two animated series for children have both featured lesbian couples. Good Luck Charlie aired an episode in 2014 in which one of the four children has a playdate with a kid who has two moms. Doc McStuffins had an episode in 2017 featuring lesbian moms voiced by openly gay actresses Wanda Sykes and Portia de Rossi.

So proud to be in this episode.  Love is love!  #Docmcstuffins https://t.co/WmvWXURnZE
