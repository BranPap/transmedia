Bathroom Break Fight Between Man and Transgender Woman Ends with Golf Club Assault

PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., April 8 (UPI) –An alleged argument about taking pit stop ended with a transgender woman being arrested for hitting a man in the head with a golf club.

Florida Highway Patrol troopers responded to reports of a fight on the Florida Turnpike at the Port St. Lucie/Fort Pierce service plaza and found Colby Yandow, 23, and Kenneth Jackson, 35.

Yandow, who told troopers she’s “a trans-gender individual who has completed his sexual reassignment surgery, but has not updated his driver’s license information to reflect such,” claimed that she hit Jackson in self-defense after being punched in the face.

The suspects, both of whom smelled of booze, live together in Orlando.

Jackson was arrested on a battery charge and Yandow was arrested on charges that include aggravated battery.
