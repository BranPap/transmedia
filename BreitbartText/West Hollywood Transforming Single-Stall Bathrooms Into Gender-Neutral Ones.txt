West Hollywood Transforming Single-Stall Bathrooms Into Gender-Neutral Ones

A law requiring all single-stall bathrooms to replace gender-specific signs (male, female) with gender-neutral signs will go into effect in West Hollywood on Thursday.

Councilwoman Abbe Land, who initiated the ordinance, said it would “provide a safe and accessible environment for all people” in a city council meeting last month, notes the Los Angeles Times. 

Businesses and public facilities will have 60 days to comply by replacing existing signs on the exterior of single-stall restrooms to indicate that they are gender neutral and make any needed changes to make them accessible to all people.

In September of 2014, University of California President Janet Napolitano pledged to start converting single-stall bathrooms at UC schools into gender-neutral ones.

If you see a single-stall public bathroom at a restaurant or business, let us know and we will notify the business owner or manager to make sure it gets changed! There are three simple ways you can let us know:

“I hope that we can encourage other cities to adopt this,” Land said of West Hollywood’s new move, according to the Times. “It’s really so easy when you think about it, and I’m glad that we’re one of the cities that is moving forward on that.”
