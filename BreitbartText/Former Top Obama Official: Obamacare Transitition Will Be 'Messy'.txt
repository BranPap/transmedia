Former Top Obama Official: Obamacare Transitition Will Be 'Messy'



“We know it’s going to be messy,” said Jeffrey Crowley. “There are going to be things that come up that are unanticipated.”

The panel discussion centered on how Obamacare will affect HIV/AIDS and the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. “If we do everything we can possibly think of, it’s still going to be a messy transition, but we’ll end up in a better place,” said Crowley.

The seminar also touched on how illegal immigrants, who are not supposed to be eligible for Obamacare, will be affected by the new law.

Health and Human Services Public Health Policy Director Mayra Alvarez said public health advocates should pay close attention to how the passage of the much-discussed comprehensive immigrant reform package deals with healthcare. 

Obamacare’s full implementation is slated to begin in 10 months.
