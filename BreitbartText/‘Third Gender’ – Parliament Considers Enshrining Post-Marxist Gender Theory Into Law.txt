‘Third Gender’ – Parliament Considers Enshrining Post-Marxist Gender Theory Into Law

The government’s new Parliamentary Women’s and Equalities Committee is to hear evidence from a one-sided panel on the possibility of introducing a “third gender” into the British legal system.

According to The Gender Recognition Act of 2004, the transgendered can already legally swap between the two legally recognised genders in the UK, so long as they, “have lived fully for the last two years in their acquired gender; and intend to live permanently in their acquired gender.”

The Home Office has been considering gender neutral passports since 2011, and in 2014 an early day motion calling for there to be an “X” category on British passports gained the support of dozens of MPs.

This time, “the Committee is likely to investigate whether the current application process is too expensive, bureaucratic and medicalised. It may look at whether people should be able to define their own gender (including non-binary identity) for the purposes of gender recognition,” it was announced on the committee’s webpage.

“The panel,” we are told, “reflects a range of transgender identities and experiences,” yet not a single gender critical feminist or Christian, say, who is skeptical of the idea of enshrining post-Marxist gender theory into British law will appear on it.

The second panel on “personal experiences” will feature four people who choose to define their gender in unusual ways, including “non-gendered” campaigner Christie Elan-Cane.

The committee was prompted into investigating the issue when Law firm K&L Gates made a submission in September on behalf Elan-Cane. Clifford Chance law firm also submitted a report to HM Passport Office in March on his/her behalf, requesting to be recognized as “non-gendered” on a passport.
