Cory Booker: We Need to Talk More About Transgender Americans

Sen. Cory Booker argued during the Democrat presidential debate on Wednesday that Americans need to talk more about transgender people.

“We do not talk enough about trans-Americans, especially African American trans-Americans, and even incredibly high rates of murder right now,” he said.

Booker also said that up to 30 percent of LGBT schoolchildren were afraid to go to school.

He then argued that Democrats needed to do more than just support the Equality Act proposed in Congress.
