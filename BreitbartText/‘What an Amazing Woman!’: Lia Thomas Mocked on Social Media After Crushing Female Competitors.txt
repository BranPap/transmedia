‘What an Amazing Woman!’: Lia Thomas Mocked on Social Media After Crushing Female Competitors

Lia Thomas, a man, got in the water on Thursday and virtually lapped his female competitors as he cruised to an easy victory in the NCAA women’s  500-yard freestyle race.

After the race, ESPN gave Thomas an interview in which they didn’t even pretend like there was anything weird about what Thomas was doing, or anything wrong with him asserting his inherent male advantages over the female competitors:

“It means the world to be here.”

While ESPN may have felt fine treating this absolute farce like an actual athletic event, the internet didn’t pull any punches.

This is a man. 

A man who is stealing opportunities from women in sport. 

Remove this misogynist fraud once and for all.

Why is @SportsCenter even entertaining an interview with “Lia”? Go speak with Emma, the real first place winner.

Lia Thomas spent 21 years of his life as a man. Said he is now a woman and in less than a year became a national champion in women’s swimming. And as a society, we’re supposed to accept this as totally okay?

So far in 2022:

 “Rachel” Levine was named “woman of the year.”

“Lia” Thomas became the best “female” swimmer.

What’s next? Will @DanCrenshawTX or @AdamKinzinger be named “Republican of the Year”?

🏻‍♂️ clown world.

This picture tells you everything you need to know about what the other competitors (who are actually women) feel about Lia Thomas being allowed to compete. #SaveWomensSports pic.twitter.com/Xo4RCEBOXL

I have two young daughters who are just beginning to show an interest in sports. 

I don't want to have to look them in the eye one day and explain why the best they can possibly do is second place.

This is totally unfair. Women's sports are for women. pic.twitter.com/f2GagtshGW

Others chose to use the moment to celebrate Emma Weyant, the female Olympian who came in second behind Thomas. Though she came in second, given that Weyant is an actual female, she is the true winner of the race.

This is Emma Weyant from the University of Virginia.  

She finished in second place to Lia Thomas in the women’s 500 Free at the NCAA national championships.

But she’s the true winner to all of us. pic.twitter.com/RbMAT3w2Dz

Others chose to find the humor at the moment:

Thomas has other races scheduled for Friday, so there are more records from past female competitors and more hopes and dreams of current female competitors to be erased.

Good job, NCAA.
