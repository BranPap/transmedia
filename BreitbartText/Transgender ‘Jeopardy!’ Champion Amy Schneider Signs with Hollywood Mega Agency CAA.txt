Transgender ‘Jeopardy!’ Champion Amy Schneider Signs with Hollywood Mega Agency CAA

Transgender Jeopardy! contestant Amy Schneider has reportedly signed with Hollywood mega-agency CAA, a move that is sure to boost Schneider’s visibility and nascent celebrity status following a 40-game winning streak that came to an end this week.

CAA is a Democratic stalwart, having previously represented now-President Joe Biden, first lady Jill Biden, and vice president Kamala Harris.

Watch below:



Schneider ranks as No. 2 on Jeopardy!’s all-time consecutive wins, behind only all-time champion Ken Jennings. Schenider’s earnings on the show amount to $1.4 million.

The mainstream media’s coverage of Schneider’s Jeopardy! streak frequently described the contestant as a “woman” without referring to the fact that Schneider is a transgender who was born a man and now identifies as a woman.

The Hollywood Reporter article called Schneider “the most successful woman ever to compete on Jeopardy!”
