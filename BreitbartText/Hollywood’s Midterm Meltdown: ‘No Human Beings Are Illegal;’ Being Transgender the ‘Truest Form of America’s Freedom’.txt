Hollywood’s Midterm Meltdown: ‘No Human Beings Are Illegal;’ Being Transgender the ‘Truest Form of America’s Freedom’

Less than two weeks from the most expensive and, perhaps, consequential midterm election in a generation, some of Hollywood’s most influential stars have taken to social media to spew deranged and self-centered hot takes about President Donald Trump and the issues facing the nation.

This “caravan” has been going on for 20 years as refugees flee the violence of Guatemala, Honduras & El Salvador. Most end up in Mexico & are assisted by international refugee groups. Few walk the 1,000+ miles to the US. Trump is using this racist fear tactic to win the Midterms. pic.twitter.com/AIA8YyEqgF

Actor John Cusack declared that “no human beings are illegal.”

No human beings are illegal – we are all immigrants – https://t.co/ukBmjdaSBE

Actress Bette Midler dropped this gem of a conspiracy, insisting that the people in the caravan were paid by Trump surrogates to travel to the United States.

I think #Trump had surrogates encourage (or pay) that caravan to come north so that he has something else to rail against besides Hillary and Obama!  He knows his base really REALLY well!!

Chiming in the report that the Trump administration is planning to roll back the Obama regimes Transgender rules, pop icon Barbra Streisand said gender can’t be defined with a birth certificate.

You can’t define gender with a birth certificate. But that is what Trump is trying to do. https://t.co/Yjfmw593BI

To the trans kids out there who are terrified by this administration, my daughter and I are with you. Your existence is the truest form of America’s freedom. You will not be erased. Not on my watch. Not on humanity’s watch. Your fight is our fight. #WontBeErased @TransEquality pic.twitter.com/B68EMLxRKl

To actor John Leguizamo, the left commits mere vandalism — except when their shooting at Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA).

But look at the acts: the left’s is vandalism. The right is attempted murder!! Neither is right but one is more wrong than the other. https://t.co/vmIwMSYFen

SANE PEOPLE: the caravan story is bullshit built by Trump and his people to enflame racial divides and juice his base before the midterm, we’re not taking the bait 

NEVER TRUMPERS: liberals apparently want to open borders to rapists and terrorists so Trump is what you deserve

Actor Carl Reiner couldn’t resist comparing President Trump to Hitler.
