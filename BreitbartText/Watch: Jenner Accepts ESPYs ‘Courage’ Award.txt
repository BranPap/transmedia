Watch: Jenner Accepts ESPYs ‘Courage’ Award

On Wednesday, the recently transitioned Caitlyn Jenner accepted the “Arthur Ashe Courage Award” during ESPN’s ESPYs award show, broadcasted on ABC.  He was introduced by United States Women’s National Soccer Team captain Abby Wambach and gave a speech that said was meant to inspire others to accept one another.

“So, for the people out there, wondering what this is all about, whether it’s about courage or controversy or publicity, well, I’ll tell you what it’s all about,” concluded Jenner. “It’s about what happens from here. It’s not just about one person. It’s about thousands of people. It’s not just about me. It’s about all of us accepting one another. We’re all different. That’s not a bad thing. That’s a good thing and while it may not be easy to get past the things you always don’t understand, I want to prove that it is absolutely possible if we only do it together. Thank you so much for this platform.”
