CBS to Create ‘Transgender’ Legal Drama, Starring Laverne Cox

Transgender actress Laverne Cox, best known for her recurring role in the Netflix series Orange Is the New Black, is slated to co-star in a new transgender-themed CBS legal drama, titled Doubt.

The actress will reportedly  play a transgender Ivy League-educated attorney who goes to bat for her clients and doesn’t take “no” for an answer.

According to Entertainment Weekly, the role was created specifically for a transgender character. CBS is apparently trying to strike gold, as Nielsen revealed shows with diverse leads are ranked at the top of television ratings.

Cox, who has also appeared on The View, was the first openly transgender person to receive a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award in the acting category.

As of yet, no release date has been set for Doubt.
