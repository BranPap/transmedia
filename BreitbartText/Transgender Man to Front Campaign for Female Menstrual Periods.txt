Transgender Man to Front Campaign for Female Menstrual Periods

A 23-year-old British model is set to become the first transgender man to front a campaign meant to break the stigma of female menstrual periods.

Transgender model Kenny Jones is the face of U.K.-based women’s product company Pink Parcel’s “#ImOn” campaign.

A video for the company’s new period effort describes the campaign thusly, saying the “I’m On turns the phrase we most commonly use to describe being on our period on its head, challenging negative perceptions of periods and turning the conversation into a more positive one.”



“I remember that my body didn’t understand what was going on,” said Jones, who began to transition from a girl to a boy at 14-years-old and began taking hormones at 17. “I didn’t want my period and there was a lot of confusion within myself. It did make me realize that periods weren’t something I wanted to happen to me and it motivated and pushed me to further my transition.”
