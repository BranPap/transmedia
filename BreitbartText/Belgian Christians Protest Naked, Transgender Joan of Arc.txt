Belgian Christians Protest Naked, Transgender Joan of Arc

A Christian organization has launched an online petition to block a Brussels opera house from staging a performance of an oratorio called Joan of Arc at the Stake, in which the Catholic saint appears naked.

The Pro Europa Christiana Federation objects to the performance of Arthur Honegger’s oratorio, Jeanne d’Arc au bûcher, or Joan of Arc at the Stake, insisting that the production is “obscene and transgender.”

Along with its online petition, which so far has garnered more than 10,000 signatures, the group has written to the director of La Monnaie Opera House, Peter de Caluwe, and to the Belgian minister in charge of cultural affairs, Didier Reynders, asking that the show be canceled because it is offensive to Christians.

Mr. de Caluwe dismissed the petition, saying this week that he was “astonished” by the association’s claims. Insisting that they are “lies” fabricated by people who have not seen the program, he declared that the show will go ahead as planned.

“La Monnaie is particularly committed to freedom of expression,” de Caluwe said. “We respect the opinions of others, but we ask them to show the same respect to us.”

The show, which is set to run from November 5-12, is orchestrated by Italian director Romeo Castellucci.
