Senators Demand NBA Take All-Star Game from NC over Transgender Restroom Law

Six U.S. senators call on NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to move the All-Star Game from Charlotte because of a law forbidding individuals from using multiple-person bathrooms designated for the opposite sex at government facilities.

“The Act forces transgender individuals to use bathrooms that differ from their gender identity and preempts local governments from passing non-discrimination ordinances protecting members of the LGBT community,” the missive signed by Patrick Leahy, Jeff Merkley, Cory Booker, Mark Kirk, Tammy Baldwin, and Patty Murray reads. “Put plainly, HB2 provides businesses, government contractors, hotels, and other institutions with a license to discriminate, and no city council or county government can do a thing about it. This is just wrong.”

“We hold no ill-will towards the people of Charlotte,” the Northern senators insist of the host city of the 2017 All-Star Game, “who passed an antidiscrimination measure that HB2 overturned, or towards the people of North Carolina. However, we cannot condone nor stand idly by as North Carolina moves to legalize and institutionalize discrimination against the LGBT community. Nor should the NBA allow its premier annual event to be hosted in such a state.”

But why stop at the separatist symbolism encoded on the restroom door? To paraphrase Dr. King’s words, Governor McCrory, tear down this stall!
