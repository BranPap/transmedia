Houston Pastors: Bathroom Ordinance Victory a Defeat of National Leftist LGBT Agenda

HOUSTON, Texas – A coalition that represents hundreds of pastors who opposed Houston Mayor Annise Parker’s pro-LGBT ordinance, are calling the resounding defeat of the Houston bathroom ordinance, a “national victory” and the local defeat of a national Leftist LGBT agenda.

Reverend Dave Welch, the Executive Director of US Pastors Council said, “The deception engaged in by Mayor Parker, the Greater Houston Partnership, even some of the media to deflect what this issue is about was ultimately unsuccessful, with the people of this city.”

The pastors’ organization pointed out that this has never been a “local issue” but part of the national pro-LGBT Human Rights Campaign agenda to use local ordinances to accomplish what they have been unable to do at the federal level apart from activist courts.

“We will not allow national anti-faith, anti-family groups like Human Rights Campaign, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood to destroy this great city.  Houston is not a perfect city, however it is indeed the most diverse and welcoming city of its kind in the nation, so from the very beginning this was a solution looking for a problem; creating division where there was none,” stated the pastors.

The pastors asserted “their mutual commitment to staying united and ‘on the field’ to assure that future city administrations are held accountable to the rule of law, what is best for all the people and to basic standards of decency and integrity.”

“We are blessed beyond measure that God has honored the eighteen months, thousands of volunteer hours, persevering against a massive legal machine and abuse of law to achieve two Texas Supreme Court victories restoring the right of the people to vote and finally the incredible work to turn out the vote by our churches throughout Houston,” stated the representative of the pastors’ coalition.
