Twitter Suspends Journalist Andy Ngo for ‘Hateful Conduct’

Twitter has suspended the account of Andy Ngo, a journalist known for covering and being violently targeted by the far-left extremist “Antifa” movement, after he attempted to argue that the United States is a safer place for transgender people than most other countries in the world.

In response, Ngo tweeted:

Ngo reported to the Post Millennial, where he is editor-at-large, that Twitter subsequently sent him a message informing him that his account had been suspended for violating the platform’s rules against “hateful conduct.”

This rule states that you “may not promote violence against, threaten, or harass other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.”

Twitter informed Ngo that his account will be restored in 12 hours.

Twitter has not suspended left-wing journalists who have tweeted racial abuse. In 2014, left-wing tech journalist Sarah Jeong tweeted a number of vitriolic statements about white people, comparing them to “dogs pissing on fire hydrants” and “grovelling goblins.”

“It’s kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men,” said Jeong in a further tweet.

Even though these racist tweets were given widespread media coverage, in both the conservative and mainstream press, Twitter did not require Jeong to delete them, nor suspend her account. In fact, Twitter verified her account shortly after the bigoted tweets resurfaced.
