With regards to “being a mom,” Furman said that it’s “beautiful and holy and I love it.”

“I have not yet mentioned in public that I’m a parent because I have been afraid of being judged and grilled about it as if it’s anyone’s business other than mine and my family’s,” Furman said.

Furman recalled seeing “approximately zero examples” of “trans women raising children. So here’s one for anyone who wants to see one.”
“I’m a trans woman and a mom. This is possible,” Furman reiterated. “I never dreamed it was possible to be happy and self-realized and trans and uncloseted, and also become a parent. But it is and I am doing it.”

Furman joins President Joe Biden’s Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel Levine, and Juno and X-Men star Elliot Paige — formerly known as Ellen Paige — Sports Illustrated swimsuit models Valentina Sampaio and Leyna Bloom, and Nevada beauty pageant winner Kataluna Enriquez, among others publican figures who’ve come out as transgender.
