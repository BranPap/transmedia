Joe Biden Asks Transgender ‘Barbie Pocket’ Man for Midterm Support

President Joe Biden has asked a stereotype-embracing transgender advocate to help Democrats survive the 2022 midterm elections, says a video by the advocate, Dylan Mulvaney.

He explains, “I get to sit down with Joe Biden and NowThis News and I get to ask him a few questions about trans issues.” Mulvaney added that he will talk to Biden about “my transness.”

“I’m ready to step up and show that trans people, we’re not going anywhere and that trans kids, they deserve a fighting chance to be their true selves,” Mulvaney added. He also included a call for his fans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections. The video of Biden meeting with Mulvaney and other activists will be released Sunday, Mulvaney said. The Biden administration is fully backing the transgender agenda.

Ulta Beauty hosted an interview with Mulvaney on motherhood and girlhood. The two subjects of the interview were Mulvaney, who identifies as transgender, and another man who identifies as “genderfluid.” During the interview, Mulvaney said he wants to become a mother, falsely claiming, “I want to be a mom one day — and I absolutely can!”

Mulvaney makes a similar comment in another clip when he explains that people stared at him in public when he wore tight pants. He explains, “oh, I forgot my crotch doesn’t look like other women’s crotches sometimes because mine doesn’t look like a little barbie pocket.” He added that he was hoping to “normalize women having bulges … because we’re coming up on bikini season.”
