WATCH: State Farm Slammed for Pushing Gender Indoctrination Books on Children

Consumers’ Research is calling out State Farm over the insurance company’s apparent advocacy for indoctrinating children with gender theory.

“Like a good neighbor? More like a creepy neighbor,” the video asks, making fun of the insurance company’s slogan “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.”

In late May, Consumers’ Research exposed State Farm’s partnership with the GenderCool Project — an organization that targets children for conversations about being transgender and nonbinary.

🚨 Emails leaked to @ConsumersFirst from concerned @StateFarm employees show the company engaged in the woke indoctrination of kids age 5+.

According to emails leaked to Consumers’ Research, local agents were asked to participate in a “unique project” that asked them to purchase books targeted toward America’s toddlers in order to teach them about gender ideology and subsequently donate them to schools and public libraries.

Pointing out that this project has been going on since January, the ad asks, “how many of these books are out there? And where?”

According to Consumers’ Research, after they exposed the insurance company’s ties to GenderCool, State Farm “quickly ended its partnership.”

“The fact that State Farm got caught delivering these books intended to indoctrinate our children and have yet to do more than send a couple internal emails is absolutely shameful,” Consumers’ Research Executive Director Will Hild said in a press release. “Why would an insurance agency like State Farm, a company founded on family values that touts being a good neighbor, try to encourage kindergarteners to question their gender?”

“They owe their customers, agents, and parents everywhere real answers and a plan-of-action,” Hild continued. “If State Farm actually cares, then they need to clean up their mess.”
