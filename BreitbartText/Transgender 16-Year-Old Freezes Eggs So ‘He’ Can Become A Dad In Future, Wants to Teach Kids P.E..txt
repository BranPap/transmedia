Transgender 16-Year-Old Freezes Eggs So ‘He’ Can Become A Dad In Future, Wants to Teach Kids P.E.

Transgender teen Riley Middlemore has frozen her eggs before undergoing gender reassignment surgery in order that she can become a ‘biological dad’ after becoming a man. 

Riley was born a girl called Rebecca, but revealed to her mother last Christmas that she wanted to have a gender change.

“She said, ‘You want to be a boy?’ She had guessed, and just hugged me.”

The Mirror reports why Riley has decided to freeze her eggs. She said:

“I want to get married one day. I’ve always wanted a family and I love children. My partner would be the surrogate and carry my eggs. That way I can have children that are biologically mine with my partner.”

Riley, who says she was always a tomboy, starts college next month where she will be studying sport, aiming to become a Physical Education teacher to children in future.
