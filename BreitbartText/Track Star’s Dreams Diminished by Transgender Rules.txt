Track Star’s Dreams Diminished by Transgender Rules

Alanna Smith, a teenage athlete from Connecticut, recently lamented that her standing in high school track has been diminished because of boys competing as transgender girls in her sport.

“When I didn’t have to run against biological males, I felt I had a chance,” the 17-year-old girl said. “Whether I came in first or fifth place, I knew that was the spot I deserved. Now it’s dispiriting to know who is going to win.”

The teen told the Times that she hopes Connecticut would follow the lead of the state of Mississippi after the Magnolia State enacted a law limiting people who claim to be transgender to competing only in categories that correspond to their birth gender.

“I would hope Connecticut would get on board, but there are no signs of that,” Alanna told the paper.

“Alanna runs 100 meters in 12 seconds, which is fast by nearly anyone’s standards. But the athletic standards in her family are higher than most others,” the paper noted. But it isn’t enough to beat boys.

Smith, who was born in Louisiana and moved to Connecticut when she was five, said her family supports her lawsuit.

“My coach and my teammates all support what I’m doing, but we don’t really talk about it much,” she exclaimed. “The backlash comes mostly on social media from people I don’t even know.”

“I just want fairness to be made in all women’s sports,” she said. “This isn’t fair, and I only have a few seasons,” Smith concluded.
