Pediatricians Call Gender Discordance Conditioning Child Abuse

The American College of Pediatricians (ACP) has issued a report urging legislators and educators to reject all policies that condition children to accept as normal “a life of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex.” They say endorsing “gender discordance” is “child abuse.”

The report published by the ACP concludes that “conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.”

These pediatricians say that encouraging gender discordance will lead children to go to “gender clinics” where they will be given “puberty-blocking drugs.” “Children who use puberty blockers to impersonate the opposite sex will require cross-sex hormones in late adolescence,” the report says. Cross-sex hormones are associated with dangerous health risks including but not limited to high blood pressure, blood clots, stroke and cancer, the ACP reports.

The ACP also reports that taking these drugs “virtually ensures that they will ‘choose’ a lifetime of carcinogenic and otherwise cross-sex hormones” and will also “likely consider unnecessary surgical mutilation of their healthy body parts as young adults.”

Moreover, they report, “According to the DSM-V, as many as 98 percent of gender confused boys and 88 percent of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty.”

Conservatives and traditionalists believe that glorifying or affirming transgenders such as Caitlyn Jenner, is a liberal, Hollywood attempt at conditioning children to embrace gender discordance, and to accept chemical and surgical “remedies” to address this problem.
