FLYNN: Trump Trans Ban More Than Meets the Eye

President Donald Trump earlier this week tweeted out news of his ban on trans people serving in the military.

“After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,” Trump explained. “Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.”

After all, what army in the world would not want to follow Optimus Prime, a TTM (truck-to-man) transformer, into battle? His ion blaster and energon-axe surpass the capability of any weapons system currently employed by the U.S. armed forces. By morphing from a biped into an 18-wheeler into a fighter jet, the leader of the transformers wields amazing versatility regarding transportation, too.

And here lies the rub. To robots, transformers remain human. To humans, they remain robots. Even within the RCDT (robot, cyborg, droid, thingamabob) community, transformers struggle to find acceptance. So, like fatsos, geezers, and beardos, the American military regards them as weirdos.

America’s enemies, weary of the prospect of a hasty, confused retreat when facing a charging throng of transformers, cheer this decision. More tellingly, humanity’s enemies, the Decepticons, cheer it, too.
