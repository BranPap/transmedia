Report: Bruce Jenner Knew He Was Meant to Be a Woman at Age Five

After months of rumors that former Olympian Bruce Jenner is looking to transition into a woman, the reality TV star has reportedly informed family members that he has known he was meant to be a woman since he was five years old, reports TMZ.

Jenner has reportedly kept his “true self” hidden for more than 60 years, and even while taking home the gold medal in the decathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics, the former AP Male Athlete of the Year was a woman in his own mind.

In January, it was announced Jenner would be undergoing cross-hormone therapy in order to become a woman. He is supposedly also documenting his “journey” through a series, planned for television.

An unnamed family source spoke at the time of Jenner’s changing appearance and his future plans.
