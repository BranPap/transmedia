Greek Sports Star Gets 10-Month Sentence After Calling Child Sex Changes an ‘Abomination’

Legendary Greek footballer Vassilis Tsiartas has been given a 10-month suspended prison sentence over comments critical of child sex changes.

Tsiartas, who played a key role in the Greek national team’s shock victory in the UEFA European Football Championship in 2004 and finished his career without receiving a single red card, was prosecuted under a supposed anti-racism law which, somewhat perversely, includes provisions against public incitement to violence or hatred on the basis of gender identity.

“Legitimise paedophiles too, to complete the crimes,” he added.

For this, Tsiartas was fined 5,000 euros (~£4,380/$4,980) and handed a 10-month suspended prison sentence.

Tsiartas, for his part, has vowed to appeal the decision.
