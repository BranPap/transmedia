Death Certificates For Transsexual Californians to Reflect Gender Change

California lawmakers passed a bill for Gov. Jerry Brown to sign that will ensure transgendered Californians the ability to show gender status on their death certificate at the time of their death instead of at birth.

AB 1577 was approved easily by a 66-4 vote. It is one of several measures expanding rights for LGBT Californians, reported Reuters. Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins, (D-San Diego), explained that after we die “we are often at the mercy of others to treat us with dignity.” With the new bill, according to the Speaker, “individuals are given basic human dignity by honoring their authentic selves when they pass so that more pain is not inflicted upon grieving loved ones or the community.”

Recently, the California legislature passed a bill that provides gay marriage couples to list themselves as father, mother or parent on birth certificates. Last year the legislature gave transgendered individuals the right to use the restroom associated with their new gender identity and allows them to play on sports teams in accordance with their chosen sex status.
