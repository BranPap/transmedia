San Antonio Chick-fil-A Vandalized with Gay Marriage Signs



Chick-fil-A workers saw the posters when they arrived to work on Thursday morning. 

Some of the signs that were taped to the Chick-fil-A windows read, “Government can not dictate love,” “Support love note hate,” and “Your son is gay and everything will be okay.”

Mayors in liberal cities–like Boston’s Thomas Menino, Chicago’s Rahm Emanuel, San Francisco’s Ed Lee, and Washington D.C.’s Vincent Gray–suggested they would try to deny Chick-fil-A business permits if the franchise tried to expand in their cities even though that would have been in violation of the First Amendment.

Liberals urged boycotts of Chick-fil-A, while a wildly popular Chick-fil-A appreciation day showed how much Americans supported religious liberty and Chick-fil-A in even the most liberal cities like Washington, D.C.
