EXCLUSIVE: Jenner Confidant Slams ‘Extremely Harmful’ Report Alleging Reality Star Has Considered De-Transitioning

In correspondence with Breitbart News, a confidant of Caitlyn Jenner slammed as “extremely harmful” and “flat out not true” a report from the author of a new book about the Kardashian family claiming that Jenner is miserable following gender reassignment surgery and has considered transitioning back to a man.

“It’s flat out not true and extremely harmful,” stated publicist Alan Nierob.

This is the second vehement denial from the Jenner camp today. Earlier on Thursday, Jenner’s rep told the New York Daily News of the report, “Of course it’s not true.”

“Not worth commenting on such an idiotic report,” the rep further told the Daily News.

The Wrap reported:

Ian Halperin, the author of “Kardashian Dynasty: The Controversial Rise of America’s Royal Family,” said that, while researching his book, multiple sources told him that the former Olympian had been miserable for months and has considered transitioning back to a man.

“One source confirmed to me Caitlyn has made whispers of ‘sex change regret,’ hinting she might go back to being Bruce Jenner,” Halperin said.

Halperin said that one long-time friend told him that, while Jenner was “thrilled” to champion transgender issues, the reality TV personality could de-transition “in the next couple years.”
