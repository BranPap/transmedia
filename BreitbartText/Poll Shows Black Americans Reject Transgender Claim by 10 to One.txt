Poll Shows Black Americans Reject Transgender Claim by 10 to One

Nine out of ten black Americans reject the claim there are more “genders” than the two male and female sexes, according to a December 20-21 poll by Rasmussen Reports.

Overall, only eight percent of the roughly 150 black Americans in the poll said they disagreed “strongly” or “somewhat” with the claim “there are [only] two genders, male and female.”

The respondents — nearly all of whom vote Democrat — were sharply different from the pro-transgender views of progressives who direct many of the party’s policies. Overall, 31 percent of Democrats embraced the claim that there are multiple genders — although 61 percent of Democrats disagreed with that transgender claim.

This intra-party split is a problem for top Democrats because they have rallied behind the transgender claim amid growing public opposition. Some of that growing opposition is caused by sports scandals where men — who claim they are transgender — are able to push women athletes off of the prize podiums while the women’s parents and friends watch.

Many black voters — and Latinos — also oppose the federal economic policy of importing migrant workers, consumers, and renters.

So far, few GOP leaders have endorsed the rising opposition to the transgender claim or used it to win more black voters from the Democratic Party.

But some with mainstream views are joining the GOP. On December 27, the New York Times profiled Winsome Sears, Virginia’s lieutenant governor elect, who was elected in November alongside the incoming GOP governor Glenn Youngkin:

In polls, the “strongly” numbers are far more useful to campaign strategists than the “somewhat” numbers, and they are better guides to the voters’ final choices amid the chaos and complexity of political campaigns.
