Four Migrants Face Trial in Connection with Transgender Woman’s Death

Four North African migrants are facing trial for their role in the death of a transgender woman whose body was discovered in a Swiss lake last year.

Speaking to the Swiss paper, Gaëlle’s mother explained how her daughter, formerly her son named Michael, “only wanted to be a normal woman with a normal life.”

In November last year, prosecutor Stephan Johner claimed that two out of the four migrants had met Gaëlle in Vevey in the evening of the murder and had gone to the lakeshore to smoke cannabis.

The 27-year-old was also alleged to have been drinking heavily and was on prescription anti-anxiety medication, reducing her tolerance to the substances. The migrants then allegedly began sexually abusing her with the fourth migrant giving the other cocaine in exchange to sexually abuse her.

The migrants initially denied sexually abusing Gaëlle but confessed after DNA belonging to three out of four of them was recovered by investigators. A judgement in the trial is expected later in the week.

The case bears similarities to the high-profile murder of a transgender prostitute in Paris, France, that saw nine illegal migrants arrested.

Vanesa Campos was killed last year in August after being shot, allegedly by a group of migrants who had previously been harassing and robbing the clients of prostitutes in the area.

Earlier this year, several more illegal migrants were arrested after they beat and robbed transgender prostitutes in the same area as the murder.
