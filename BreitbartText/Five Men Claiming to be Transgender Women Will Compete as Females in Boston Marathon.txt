Five Men Claiming to be Transgender Women Will Compete as Females in Boston Marathon

Boston Marathon officials have announced that men claiming to be transgender women, will be allowed to compete in the women’s category for this year’s race, reports say.

“We take people at their word. We register people as they specify themselves to be,” said Tom Grilk, chief of the Boston Athletic Association. “Members of the LGBT community have had a lot to deal with over the years, and we’d rather not add to that burden.”

ABC notes that five men have already signed up in the women’s category for the 2018 race to be held on April 16.

Five men are registered to run in the women's division later this month. Same misogyny, different decade. #NotProgresshttps://t.co/3D08l8eM5E

Several other big city marathons are also pondering new recognition for transgender contestants. Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and even the UK’s London marathon committees, are moving to formally accept transgender runners.

The question of men claiming to be transgender women is not just a problem for marathons. The issue has been a thorny question for professional sports, colleges and high schools, and even the Olympics.

Last year the International Olympics Committee announced that it would allow men claiming to be women to compete as long as they have reduced their levels of testosterone to certain levels in an effort to dull the natural, physical advantage that natural-born males have over natural-born female athletes.
