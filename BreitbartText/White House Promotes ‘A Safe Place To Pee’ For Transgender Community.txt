White House Promotes ‘A Safe Place To Pee’ For Transgender Community

The White House is reaching out to the transgender community for a list of things that its members want as they follow their lifestyle choices.

“In the transgender space, there exists no data,” Patil told Fortune Magazine. “There’s none.”

Patil helped launched the initiative in order to quantify the desires from the transgender community so that the federal government could reach out with assistance.

Jobs, healthcare, housing, a safe place to pee. It’s your time to be heard. Share your #transneeds pic.twitter.com/LimPVJlzjs

Another message from the account reads:


Tell us what the federal government can do for you. We’re collecting data and providing recommendations #transneeds https://t.co/snhkByX9fM — #transneeds (@transneeds) September 30, 2015


Patil praised the launch of the movement on Twitter earlier this morning:

Very excited to see the transgender community lead by creating the #transneeds initiative. Send in your transgender needs w/ that #.

The account also posted a photo of the LGTBQ activists on Twitter at the White House holding a sign promoting their hashtag.


Incredibly proud of our small, all volunteer staff – help us spread the word. Tweet/share @transneeds #transneeds pic.twitter.com/2Ly9epPv5g — #transneeds (@transneeds) September 30, 2015


According to the Twitter account, the #transneeds project is the result of the White House LGBTQ Tech Summit which was held in order to understand the needs of the transgender community.

“Amongst and in our community, the trans community faces some of the greatest challenges for inclusion and economic inclusion,” U.S. Chief Technology Officer Megan Smith said during the event which took place in August.

Glad to be a part of this effort. Share your #transneeds and be heard! https://t.co/hESir0AEY9

#transneeds An HHS rule that explicitly covers GRS and other transgender-specific health care. Right now the rule has giant loopholes.
