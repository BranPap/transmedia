Karen Bass: ‘I Have a Hard Time Imagining’ California Republicans Would Vote for ‘Trans Candidate’

Representative Karen Bass (D-CA) said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” that she has “a hard time imagining” that Republicans will vote Olympic gold medalist and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner in the election to recall Governor Gavin Newsom (D-CA).

Anchor George Stephanopoulos said, “You’re a member of Congress from California. It looks like a recall is going to happen on Governor Newsom this fall, and Caitlyn Jenner announced her candidacy for governor on Friday. You remember that Democrat Governor Gray Davis was recalled in 2003, and Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor. Are you worried history will repeat itself?”

Stephanopoulos said, “Do you think her candidacy is real for or a stunt?”

Bass said, “I’m not sure. I’m really not sure. Whatever it is, though, you know, she is getting a lot of publicity. Maybe that’s helpful, but it’s certainly not helpful to the state of California. We have been doing well. We have a lot more to do there in terms of getting ahold of the virus and opening up the economy. The economy is going to open up again in a few weeks. That really needs to be our focus. I think that it is completely unnecessary and inappropriate that the governor has to spend time now fighting a recall.”
