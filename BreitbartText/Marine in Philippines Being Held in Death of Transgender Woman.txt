Marine in Philippines Being Held in Death of Transgender Woman

A U.S. Marine in the Philippines is being held in connection with the death of a transgender woman after finding out she was anatomically male “following a night at a local disco.”

According to ABC News, the deceased–Jeffrey Laude–was a Philippine national, and “a joint Naval Criminal Investigative Service and Philippine National Police investigation” is now underway.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer reports that Laude and a “male, white foreigner” checked into a hotel in Olongapo on October 11 at approximately 11:30 pm. The suspect “left the hotel alone a few minutes after he and Laude entered their room.” 

A hotel attendant later found Laude in the bathroom of the hotel room, “his head slumped in the toilet.”
