Report: United Arab Emirates Imprisons Transgender Singaporean for ‘Dressing in a Feminine Way’

The United Arab Emirates has sentenced a transgender Singaporean and her friend to one year in prison “for dressing in a feminine way,” according to a report.

“Nur Qistina Fitriah Ibrahim, a transgender woman who has not undergone a sex-change operation, and her friend, freelance fashion photographer Muhammad Fadli Bin Abdul Rahman, were arrested in Abu Dhabi on Aug. 9,” reported ABC News on Thursday. “Police stopped them at Yas Mall as they tried to eat at a food court, said Radha Stirling, CEO of the advocacy group Detained in Dubai. Fadli at the time of his arrest was wearing a white T-shirt, a bow tie and earrings, his brother Muhammad Saiful Bahri Bin Abdul Rahman said.”

As an Islamic country with Sharia law, the United Arab Emirates has strict penalties for homosexuality, bisexuality, and transgenderism.

There are also laws against sex before marriage, drinking, abortion, apostasy, blasphemy, public affection, and revealing clothing, and punishments can legally include flogging, stoning, amputation, and crucifixion.

In April, a man was sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia, which borders the United Arab Emirates, on charges of “atheism” and “blasphemy,” and in June, Turkey banned an LGBT pride parade in Istanbul.
