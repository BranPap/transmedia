San Diego Airport Introduces ‘Gender-Neutral’ Bathrooms

On Mar. 5, San Diego International Airport, also known as Lindbergh Field, designated 12 restrooms as gender-neutral in its terminals. The restrooms previously were designated as single-stall family restrooms, but now they feature a logo on them that is half-man, half woman, according to FOX5 San Diego. KPBS reported that the signs also say, “Anyone can use this restroom, regardless of gender identity or expression.” All the terminals feature the new bathrooms except for the small Commuter Terminal.

In November 2013, Philadelphia required new or renovated city-owned buildings to include gender-neutral bathrooms. West Hollywood, CA required single-stall restrooms in all businesses to become gender-neutral this past January.
