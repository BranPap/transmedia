Mississippi State Senate Passes Bill Banning Transgender Athletes from Playing Girls’ Sports

The Mississippi state Senate passed a bill Thursday that would ban athletes who are biological boys from competing in girl’s or women’s sports in the state’s schools and universities.

“I’ve had numerous coaches across the state call me and believe that they feel there’s a need for a policy in Mississippi because they are beginning to have some concerns of having to deal with this,” Sen. Hill said, according to the Associated Press.

Reeves said he was “disappointed” in Biden’s executive order:

My girls practice tirelessly. They work hard. They’ve learned how to win and, yes, they’ve learned what it feels like to be on the wrong end of the final score.  It’s true bonding—my happiest and proudest Dad moments.

I don’t understand why politicians are pushing children into transgenderism in the first place. I certainly don’t understand why the President chose to make it a priority. And my heart breaks for the young women across America who will lose in this radical social experiment.

Mississippi now joins a growing group of states that are considering or are in the process of enacting such bans into law setting the stage for a showdown between the states and the federal government on transgender athletes.

Other states considering bans include Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, North and South Dakota, and Tennessee.
