Guard Faces Assault Charge for Confronting Transgender Woman Using Women’s Restroom

A report by NBC Washington says that a security guard at a Giant grocery store in Washington D.C. has been charged with simple assault after a transgender woman said he forced her out of the women’s restroom.

Belcher asked to be pointed to the bathroom. On the way, she passed a female security officer standing in the hallway, who she says then followed her into the bathroom.

“She opened the door and came in and started calling me derogatory names,” Belcher said to NBC Washington.

That is when Belcher says the officer put her hand on her shoulder and arm, grabbed her and pushed her out of the store.
