Biden Administration Promoting ‘Gender-Affirming’ Health Care for Young People

The Biden administration is openly promoting “gender-affirming” health care, particularly for young people, deeming hormone therapy for teens, as well as gender affirming surgeries on adolescents on a “case-by-case” basis, to be a standard. 

US: The Biden administration is pushing the gender affirmative model of care hard through US govt agencies. Note the ages for each medical treatment. Cross sex hormones for “early adolescents”.  Surgery for adults – and adolescents “on a case by case basis”. https://t.co/n7mtFJhJG7
