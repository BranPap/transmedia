Arkansas Legislature Overrides Gov. Hutchinson’s Veto Making Transgender Procedures for Minors Illegal

The Arkansas State Legislature has overridden Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s (R) veto Tuesday on sex-reassignment surgeries for minors, rendering certain transgender procedures illegal in the state 90 days after April 30.

Arkansas State Senate voted 25-8, and the State House voted 71-24 to override the governor’s Monday veto, which sought to block transgender procedures for minors, “including drugs and surgeries, and prevented transgender procedures from being considered deductible expenses for income tax purposes,” Breitbart News reported.

Family Council, an Arkansas-based group, called the override the “the right decision”:

But Gov. Hutchinson said, “The bill is overbroad, extreme and does not grandfather those young people who are currently under hormone treatment,” adding, “This is an example of where restraint is better than overbroad actions.”
