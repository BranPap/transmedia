Pataki to Huckabee: Give People Their Dignity, Don’t Mock Transgender People

Tuesday on CNN’s “The Situation Room With Wolf Blitzer,” Republican presidential candidate and former governor of New York George Pataki said of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee’s joke about  transgender bathroom issues we should “give people their dignity” and “respect that as opposed to mocking it or in any way trying to prevent that.”

Pataki said, “Well, I think it was meant in humor. Obviously he didn’t mean it seriously. But I think the more important point is we should give people their dignity and let them make their own decisions. People often make decisions that I don’t agree with, but in a government where it’s supposed to be of the people, if someone chooses a path that is different from mine, we should respect that as opposed to mocking it or in any way trying to prevent that.”
