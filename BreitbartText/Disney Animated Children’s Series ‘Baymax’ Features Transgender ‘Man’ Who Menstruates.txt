Disney Animated Children’s Series ‘Baymax’ Features Transgender ‘Man’ Who Menstruates

In Disney’s latest effort to smuggle transgender ideology into its entertainment for kids, the new animated Disney+ series Baymax features a transgender “man” who menstruates and gives advice on which maxi pad to buy — “the one with wings.”

The transgender character appears in episode three titled “Sofia,” in which Baymax assists a 12-year-old girl who experiences her first period.

“I always get the one wings,” the trans “man” tells Baymax.

The scene was first reported by journalist Christopher Rufo.

EXCLUSIVE: I've obtained leaked video from Disney's upcoming show "Baymax," which promotes the transgender flag and the idea that men can have periods to children as young as two years old.

The episode concludes with Sofia regaining her sense of confidence and performing at a school talent show.

The Walt Disney Co. has come under fire after videos obtained by Rufo showed company leaders bragging about  promoting an LGBTQ agenda to young children through the studio’s entertainment.

Disney CEO Bob Chapek has dedicated the company to radical LGBTQ activism and has promised to continue fighting Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law, saying the company will work to get the legislation repealed.

The company is inserting transgender and gender non-conforming characters into its entertainment for children. Disney’s Marvel superhero series Loki recently revealed that its title character is “gender fluid.”
