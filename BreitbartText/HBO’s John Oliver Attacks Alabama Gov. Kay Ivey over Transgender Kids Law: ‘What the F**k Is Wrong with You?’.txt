HBO’s John Oliver Attacks Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey over Transgender Kids Law: ‘What the F**k Is Wrong with You?’

HBO’s host John Oliver launched a vitriolic and profanity-laced attack on Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) over the state’s recently passed Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, which makes it a felony to conduct surgery or provide puberty blockers and other hormone treatments to children under the age of 19.

He also deployed the now-common Democrat tactic of describing irreversible gender transition procedures for children as “health care” and “gender-affirming” care.

“That is absolutely appalling,” Oliver said. “No one should ever be facing criminal punishment for providing health care to young people.”

Oliver then played one of Gov. Ivey’s recent campaign ads in which she spoke about the new law. “Some things are just facts,” she said. “Summer’s hot, the ocean’s big, and gender is a question of biology, not identity. Here in Alabama, we’re gonna go by how God made us, because we identify with something liberals never will — reality.”

Oliver then continued his tirade against the governor.

He continued: “As for her point there that we have to respect how God made us, do we? Really? Why? Because we’ve got too many holes, way too little hair, and necks.”

Oliver reiterated his support for minors receiving transgender procedures before turning back to attack Gov. Ivey once more.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” he said. “To put this in terms you will definitely understand, ‘Summer’s hot, ocean’s big, and the people of Alabama deserve a lot better than you.'”

As Breitbart News reported exclusively, Gov. Ivey has hit back at Oliver, saying she won’t let a left-wing celebrity dictate Alabama law.
