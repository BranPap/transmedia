Meghan McCain Slams Trump’s Transgender Military Ban: ‘Un-American and Dangerous’

The View’s Meghan McCain on Wednesday blasted President Donald Trump’s transgender military ban, describing it as “an unfair, un-American, and dangerous policy.”

McCain’s tweet included a clip from The View of two active-duty transgender military members lamenting the policy set for implementation Friday.

It is indefensible that Trump's ban on Transgender troops is being implemented on Friday. This discriminatory policy will lead Transgender service members, patriots who have decided to serve their nation, to live in the shadows.

It's an unfair, un-American, and dangerous policy. https://t.co/Yh9WxE0w8n

“On Friday, the 12th, as many as 15,000 transgender service members stand to lose their jobs,” Army Staff Sgt. Patricia King said on the ABC daytime talk show. “For those of us who are grandfathered in because we’ve already come out and we already have a diagnosis, there’s the possibility for systematic discrimination.”

In 2016, then-President Barack Obama lifted a ban on transgender people serving in the military, a move the Trump administration has attempted to reverse for over a year and a half.



Then-Defence Secretary Jim Mattis modified the policy by narrowing the ban to individuals with a history of gender dysphoria.

According to the Palm Center, there are roughly 8,980 active duty transgender troops presently serving.

McCain, the daughter of the late Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), is one of President Trump’s most vocal center-right critics.  Appearing on CNN with host Van Jones in late January, McCain said she hates the U.S. without her father’s leadership. “As an American, I hate this country without him in it. I know that sounds awful. I don’t hate America but I just hate it without his leadership,” she said when asked how she was handling her father’s passing.
