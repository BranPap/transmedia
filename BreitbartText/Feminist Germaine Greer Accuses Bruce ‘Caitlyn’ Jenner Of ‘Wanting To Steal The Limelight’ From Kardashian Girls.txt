Feminist Germaine Greer Accuses Bruce ‘Caitlyn’ Jenner Of ‘Wanting To Steal The Limelight’ From Kardashian Girls

Revered feminist author Germaine Greer has insisted that Bruce “Caitlyn” Jenner only changed sex so he could bathe in the same limelight as his Kardashian daughters. Left-wing Greer hit out at the U.S. Olympian turned reality star after Mr. Jenner was rumoured to be under consideration to be crowned Glamour’s Woman of the Year.

As Breitbart London has reported, students at Cardiff University in Wales launched an online petition to prevent her giving a speech at a Women & Power: The Lessons of the 20th Century lecture next month.

“Apparently people have decided that because I don’t think that post-operative transgender men are women, I’m not to be allowed to talk,” she said.

“I’m not saying that people should not be allowed to go through that procedure, what I’m saying is it doesn’t make them a woman. It happens to be an opinion, it’s not a prohibition.”

When asked whether she will still deliver the lecture, Greer appeared pessimistic.

“I’m getting a bit old for all this. I’m 76. I don’t want to go down there and be screamed at and have things thrown at me,” she told BBC News.

“Bugger it. It’s not that interesting or rewarding.”
