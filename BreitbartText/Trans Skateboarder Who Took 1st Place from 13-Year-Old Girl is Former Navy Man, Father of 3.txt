Trans Skateboarder Who Took 1st Place from 13-Year-Old Girl is Former Navy Man, Father of 3

The 29-year-old transgender skateboarder who beat teenage girls at a New York City women’s competition this past weekend is actually a former Navy man who was rejected from the Olympics for his high testosterone levels.

Over the weekend, Ricci Tres, who also goes by the name Ricci And Tres, beat 13-year-old skateboarder Shiloh Catori at The Boardr skating contest in New York City. Though the competition was open to all ages, the heats and finals were segregated by gender. While Shiloh appeared to support Ricci competing, female skateboarder Taylor Silverman expressed outrage on social media:

According to the Daily Mail, Ricci was previously rejected from “Women’s Street USA Skateboarding National Championships in a bid to qualify for the Olympics” for having high testosterone levels. Ricci also fathered three children in his previous marriage.
