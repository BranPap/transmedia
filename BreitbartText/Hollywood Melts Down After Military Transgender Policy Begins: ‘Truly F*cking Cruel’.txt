Hollywood celebrities once again melted over a rule instituted Friday mandating that transgender recruits in the U.S. military enlist and serve in their birth sex.

But Hollywood activists would never let facts get in the way of a good narrative.

Pop legend Cher went after President Donald Trump in her trademark style, roaring, “Transgender Military Ban Goes In2 Effect 2day. My [Heart] Breaks 4 The More Than 6000 Trans Soldiers,Whose life’s Dream It Is,2 Serve [America] & Protect Fellow Citizens.”

Actor Laverne Cox, a transgender woman best known for a staring role in Orange Is the New Black, also took to social media to attack the new policy.

"This is absolutely 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' for transgender people," Shannon Minter told ABC News, referring to the Pentagon's policy in the 1990s & early 2000s that banned gay & lesbian service members from serving openly in uniform #TransMilitaryBanhttps://t.co/yr7zGbKSHl

Actor Billy Eichner roared, “Today is an infuriating and shameful day in American history. Backwards, unnecessary and truly fucking cruel.”

Trump’s trans military ban went into effect today. It is based on a spurious, discredited notion that a person's need to transition is a "defect" or "deficiency" they need to correct. We stand with the thousands of trans service members unfairly targeted and affected by this ban.
