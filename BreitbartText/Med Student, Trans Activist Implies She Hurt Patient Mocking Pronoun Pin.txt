Med Student, Trans Activist Implies She Hurt Patient Mocking Pronoun Pin

A medical student and transgender rights activist in North Carolina appeared to suggest she hurt a patient who laughed at her pronoun pin, but has since deleted the online post.

Student Kychelle Del Rosario of Wake Forest University’s School of Medicine claimed she missed the individual’s vein while drawing blood, the Daily Mail reported Wednesday.

“I had a patient I was doing a blood draw on see my pronoun pin and loudly laugh to the staff ‘She/Her? Well of course it is! What other pronouns even are there? It?’ I missed his vein so he had to get stuck twice,” Del Rosario’s post read.

“People can wear whatever pins they want. However, people also have the right to find it stupid, and if mere poking fun at said pin is enough to cause you to injure a patient then you’re not cut out to practice medicine in any form,” one person wrote.

“First DO NO HARM or don’t go into medicine, she/her,” another commented.

The school said it was aware of what happened and was addressing the issue with the student involved, the Mail article continued, noting Del Rosario had apparently advocated for the trans community in the past:

“AP reports fresh measures aimed at opening federal government to transgender people include a new ‘X’ gender marker on U.S. passport applications beginning on April 11,” according to Breitbart News.
