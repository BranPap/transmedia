GLAAD Wins The First Annual GLAGG Award

On January 7, 2009, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) identified the worst anti-gay and anti-transgender voices of 2008. Among those on the list? Greg Gutfeld.

Gutfeld was placed on the list because, among other things, on his show (Redeye) a sex change was described as “turning a hole into a pole.”

And not in a good way.

“When I went through their list of anti-gay voices,” says Gutfeld, “I noticed who was missing: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a man who advocates proactive persecution of gays. Also missing – Islamic fundamentalists in general, who preach death for gays, lesbians, and anyone who masturbates on a holy day. GLAAD didn’t even have the balls to list certain religious minorities who voted for Prop 8 – or Scientologists who think you can deprogram homosexuality!

“Apparently, GLAAD only speaks truth to power if the ‘power’ is harmless.”

GLAGG repeatedly called GLAAD’s offices for a response.

“Wow, Greg is right – we are cowards,” says GLAAD President Neil G. Giuliano, if he happened to answer the phone calls. “After issuing a major press release regarding the list, we ran scared. But why be surprised? We prefer safe targets like Greg – and are too scared to confront real homophobia. The fact that we call Gutfeld anti-gay simply because we disagree with his politics makes us guilty of intolerance too. Worse, we’re boring. I mean, the whole list was made up of conservatives! And a Proposition – which can’t even fight back!”

The GLAGG award can be picked up in Bryant Park between 3 and 4 am – stall six. Remember to whistle “Smalltown Boy,” when entering.

Note: we’ve contacted GLAAD a number of times to do Red Eye, but no response. If you want GLAAD on Redeye to defend their bigotry, email their press office at GLAAD.org.

Ask for Dick.
