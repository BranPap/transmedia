Susan Sarandon Proud Her Son with Tim Robbins Wears Dresses

Miles Robbins, the 23-year-old son of actress Susan Sarandon and actor Tim Robbins wears dresses on occasion, and mom is awfully proud.

She later proclaimed she is overjoyed to have a son who “colors outside the lines” of traditional gender roles, according to PEOPLE.

The 68-year-old, who recently told the ladies of The View she would be open to dating a person of any age, race or gender then gushed to PEOPLE about raising her three children to see beyond “gender stereotypes.”

The actress said raising her kids in New York City helped them to grasp diversity, and explained, “I wanted to raise my kids in New York because, as a privileged kid, I think you can become very isolated and at least if you’re privileged, you should understand you’re privileged, and not take it for granted.”

She added: “I was just not vigilant or talented enough to have done it successfully in Los Angeles.”

Sarandon, who has revealed she’s inspired by Bruce Jenner’s cosmetic surgeries and hormone treatments, said:

As a mother, I know how difficult it is to survive the teenage years intact and the socialization process – if you step out of line, it’s so difficult. And there are so many kids these days who are questioning, gay or transgender, who have a very tough time and it could be very dangerous for them.

She concluded: “I think it’s really great that we are having all these conversations and getting kids to understand that there is somewhere we can go to talk it over.”

Sarandon has been crusading in recent months to remove Andrew Jackson from the $20 bill, and has yet to publicly comment on the Obama administration’s Wednesday announcement that the U.S. Treasury will place a yet-to-be named woman on the $10 bill, in lieu of Alexander Hamilton, starting in the year 2020.
