Cynical Hollywood Throws Obama a Life Preserver Named 'Same Sex Marriage'

When Barack Obama campaigned on “hope and change,” Hollywood elites bought the lie hook, line, and sinker. They believed he really did find the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) “abhorrent,” as he said on the campaign trail and in his campaign fliers. (Caveat: The campaign flyers Obama distributed in places like Arkansas, Kansas, and Nebraska, didn’t contain the same pro-gay rhetoric found in the ones he dispersed along the West Coast.)



How better to reach out to a bunch of Hollywood elites than by bashing traditional marriage while simultaneously suggesting that full blown support for gay marriage may be on the horizon?

(Pardon me for pointing out that this not only reminds us that liberal politicians will change their stated positions in a heartbeat to win the approval of elitists, but it also explains why no one in flyover country wants to see Hollywood movies anymore: because the elites in L.A. are at war with tradition and traditional values.)



Either way, the petition has been signed and elites in Hollywood now hope Obama will come along side them in supporting gay marriage. Whether he will or not remains to be seen.

It probably all depends on whether he can somehow pull out of this Libya mess with dignity. If he does that, his poll numbers may rise sufficiently to keep him from pandering to Hollywood for support. But if Libya turns into a Vietnam redo, you can bet your bottom dollar Obama will be hosting gay weddings on the South Lawn.

And if that happens, I guess Martin Sheen and LeAnn Rimes will be oh so happy.
