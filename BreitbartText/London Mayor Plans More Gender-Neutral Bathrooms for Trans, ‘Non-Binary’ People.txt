London Mayor Plans More Gender-Neutral Bathrooms for Trans, ‘Non-Binary’ People

London Mayor Sadiq Khan has reportedly called for more gender-neutral bathrooms for transgender and “non-binary” citizens in a new city plan.

According to the Guardian, Khan’s plan for London argues that more gender-neutral toilets should be built “in public spaces to help trans and non-binary people feel more comfortable.”

Khan’s plan also calls for more “changing places toilets” for people with disabilities.

“I have vowed to be a mayor for all Londoners so I am determined to ensure that everyone has the ability to enjoy our great city to its fullest,” declared Khan in a statement. “Toilets are a vital public service and can help to shape the experience of the capital for those who live here and for those visiting. We need a range of toilets that reflect the incredible diversity of this city – giving people the confidence to move around London with dignity.”

“Gender-neutral toilets are a practical solution for many people, for many reasons and it’s a powerful demonstration of acceptance that has benefits for everyone,” they claimed, adding, “But this move isn’t just practical, it’s symbolic. By introducing gender-neutral toilets, planners can show that London is a city that cherishes its diverse population.”
