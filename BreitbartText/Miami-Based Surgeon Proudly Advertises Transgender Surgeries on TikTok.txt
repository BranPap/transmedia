Miami-Based Surgeon Proudly Advertises Transgender Surgeries on TikTok

One Miami-based surgeon is proudly advertising transgender surgeries on theÂ communistÂ China-influenced app TikTok, as the radical left continues in its not-so-subtle efforts to groom children both in the classrooms and on social media.

Dr. Sidhbh Gallagher promotes double mastectomies and sex changes to kids on TikTok. This isnâ€™t informed consent. This is cheap used car sale ad tactics used to get vulnerable young people in the door. This sure seems like medical exploitation to me.  pic.twitter.com/blbMy1NGpo

Wow this is truly sick Dr. Sidhbh Gallagher uses social media to advertise the double mastectomies and sex changes she does to kids on TikTok. She uses TikTok to reel them in while making irreversible sex change surgeries sound like no big deal. ðŸŽ¥ compilation by: @LandonStarbuck pic.twitter.com/g5hy6kQWUC
