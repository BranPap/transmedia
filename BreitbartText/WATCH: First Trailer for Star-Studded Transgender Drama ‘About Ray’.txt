WATCH: First Trailer for Star-Studded Transgender Drama ‘About Ray’

The first trailer for transgender drama About Ray hit the Internet this week as more LGBT-focused entertainment is scheduled to hit the big screen this year.

Elle Fanning (Maleficent, Super 8) stars as Ray, a New York City teen who begins to transition from female to male under the worrying gaze of her mother (Naomi Watts) and grandmother (Susan Sarandon).

Family living under one roof in New York must deal with a life-changing transformation by one that ultimately affects them all. Ray is a teenager who has come to the realization that she isn’t meant to be a girl and has decided to transition from female to male. His single mother, Maggie, must track down Ray’s biological father to get his legal consent to allow Ray’s transition. Dolly, Ray’s lesbian grandmother, is having a hard time accepting that she now has a grandson. They must each confront their own identities and learn to embrace change and their strength as a family in order to ultimately find acceptance and understanding.

About Ray is directed by Gaby Dellal (On a Clear Day) off a script from newcomer Nikole Beckwith.

The film joins another high-profile transgender film hitting the big screen later this year in The Danish Girl, in which Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) will play transgender artist Lili Elbe, thought to be the first person ever to undergo gender transition surgery in the 1920s.
