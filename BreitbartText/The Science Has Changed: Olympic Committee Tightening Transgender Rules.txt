The Science Has Changed: Olympic Committee Tightening Transgender Rules

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) says it is overhauling its rules for transgender athletes saying that the science no longer supports its previous determinations.

But the committee now says that the science has changed, and its original rules are outdated, Yahoo Sports reported.

IOC medical and scientific director Richard Budgett said at a roundtable that “agreeing on another number is almost impossible and possibly irrelevant. You can debate that endlessly.”

Science is also discovering that it is difficult to nail down even within a sport.

Yale endocrinologist Myron Genel, who is consulting the IOC on the new rules, told Yahoo, “Even within a sport, like in track and field, the male to female advantage may be anywhere from 5 to 12, 13%, depending upon the activity.”

The changes in transgenders are also different from sport to sport, transgender activist, former athlete, and scientist Joanna Harper added.

The IOC said that its new rules would not be announced until later this year after initiating a deep review of the facts.

“The research needs to be more contextualized,” Katie Mascagni, the IOC’s head of public affairs, said. “What might be true for rowing and this specific discipline — where potentially testosterone or other aspects come into play in order to justify the reasons there is a disproportionate advantage — might be totally irrelevant in another context.”

Budgett promised that the new rules would be a “balance between safety, inclusion, and fairness.”
