Krauthammer:  Trump’s Abortion Statements ‘A Little Bit Confused,’ No ‘Epidemic’ Of Transgenders ‘Being Evil In Bathrooms’

Columnist Charles Krauthammer argued that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s abortion statement during an interview with NBC’s “Today” show isn’t “unreasonable,” but it does have a slight “moral contradiction” and “doesn’t square with what he said originally about punishing the woman. So he’s a little bit confused on this” and that there isn’t “an epidemic of transgenders being evil in bathrooms across the country” on Thursday’s “Special Report” on  the Fox News Channel.

Krauthammer said [relevant remarks begin around 4:00] that Trump’s statement that the GOP platform should have exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother for abortion, seems to be something he truly believes, and “[T]here is a split even among conservatives, surely in the country as a whole, on this issue. On the one hand, there’s sort of a moral contradiction. If you believe that the life of the unborn is inviolable, then why would it make any difference how that life came into existence? On the other hand, you have people like Kasich, and others, who represent a large number of conservatives, who deeply believe in the pro-life side, who think that you can’t — you have to make exceptions, almost as a kind of human mercy for the parent, the prospective mother. So I understand it’s a split. I understand that he, being somebody, Trump, who came out of an extremely high — extreme pro-choice part of the spectrum, would end up here. Although, it doesn’t square with what he said originally about punishing the woman. So he’s a little bit confused on this. But I would give credit for honesty on this, and for taking a position that is not unreasonable, in a terribly difficult moral choice.”
