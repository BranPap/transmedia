LGBT Groups Issue Statement of Support for Trayvon Martin



The groups commitment to honor Martin by “ending bias and profiling” came just hours before Martin’s friend revealed that he had profiled Zimmerman as a gay “rapist.”

Rachel Jeantel, a key witness in the prosecution’s failed case against George Zimmerman, first made headlines when inconsistencies were revealed in her statements and after she made controversial statements when she testified Martin said he racially profiled Zimmerman as a “creepy ass cracka.”
