The newest wins come on the heels of the NCAA announcing that college rules for transgender athletes will be pegged to the regulations created by pro leagues and the Olympics to govern transgender athletes.

However, the announcement will not affect Thomas‚Äô participation in UPenn swimming.

‚ÄúOver the past several years, Lia and the University of Pennsylvania worked with the NCAA to follow all of the appropriate protocols in order to comply with the NCAA policy on transgender athlete participation and compete on the Penn women‚Äôs swimming and diving team. The Ivy League has adopted and applies the same NCAA policy,‚Äù the conference said in a Jan. 6 statement.

‚ÄúThe Ivy League reaffirms its unwavering commitment to providing an inclusive environment for all student-athletes while condemning transphobia and discrimination in any form,‚Äù the statement continued.
