As both an individual, and as an educator, I have experienced and witnessed bullying in its many forms. And as the proud jichan, or grandpa, of a transgender grandchild, I hope that my granddaughter can feel safe going to school without fear of being bullied. I refuse to be a bystander while millions of people are dealing with the effects of bullying on a daily basis.

Aizumi has a transgender son.

Honda responded to the HuffPo article by stating, “I’m heartened that Marsha Aizumi was so touched by my message. Marsha has been one of the leading advocates for AAPI transgender youth, and I am proud to work with her. We need to ensure that our LGBTQ youth are never bullied because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. These children need our protection and our love.”
