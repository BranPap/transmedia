Texas Transgender Bathroom Bill Triggers National Speculation

The transgender bathroom battle is being hit straight-on in the Lone Star State. A state senator has pre-filed a bill which she says “seeks to put an end to a controversy that began in Washington D.C.”

Texas was joined by ten states in “pushing back against enforcement of these unconstitutional rules.” Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin joined Texas in the lawsuit. Just as schools were starting back after the summer, the Texas AG obtained a federal court order blocking the Obama Administration’s mandate requiring public schools to allow transgender or gender fluid students to use the bathroom of their choice. In November,a federal judge ruled that the preliminary injunction applies to public schools nationwide.

Remember North Carolina’s anti-transgender bathroom law? Now Texas is trying the same thing. https://t.co/BN6S3Q3WYY via @voxdotcom
