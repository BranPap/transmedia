Watch Live: Female Athletes Speak Out at ‘Our Bodies, Our Sports’ Rally on Title IX Anniversary

Several female athletes are set to speak at an “Our Bodies, Our Sports” rally in D.C. on the 50th anniversary of Title IX going into effect.

Competitive swimmer Riley Gaines Barker is one of many who will speak on preserving women-only sports teams on the same day fifty years ago that the Title IX law went into effect to prevent sex-based discrimination in schools.

Other speakers include world champion track athlete Cynthia Monteleone; Alanna Smith, Chelsea Mitchell, and Selina Soule, three high school runners from New England who competed against men; as well as former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI).
