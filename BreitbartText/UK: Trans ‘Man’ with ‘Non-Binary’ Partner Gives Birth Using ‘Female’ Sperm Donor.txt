UK: Trans ‘Man’ with ‘Non-Binary’ Partner Gives Birth Using ‘Female’ Sperm Donor

A female-to-male trans man and their “non-binary” partner have had a baby in Brighton, England — assisted by a trans doctor and a male-to-female trans woman sperm donor.

28-year-old Jay, Sharpe’s partner, was born a woman but has had a double mastectomy and now identifies as “non-binary”, so the pair had to inseminate Sharpe using donor sperm — which was provided by a trans woman who had retained their male sexual organs.

“It wasn’t that I was desperate to have the birthing experience or pregnancy experience, but I wanted a child and I had the facility to do it.

“Both of our families love kids. I was so glad my family were as excited about our baby as they were their other grandkids.”

Sharpe’s gender identity and people’s approach to it was also a cause of irritation, with the “mother” — described by the Mirror as “dad” to the child they give birth to — saying it was “frustrating that people didn’t just ask my gender or not use it”.

Nevertheless, Shape “actually liked my pregnant body and liked being bigger.”

“It was very affirming and I really enjoyed it – I’m a man and I get pregnant,” Sharpe added.

“Like with many things, people have got it into their heads ‘this is a female thing, this is a male thing’. Having a child is male, female, everyone… I don’t think pregnancy is the ultimate female experience, therefore it didn’t challenge me as a man.”
