Biden: No Question That Transgenders Can Serve in U.S. Military

As the Obama administration works to lift the long-standing ban of transgenders serving in the United States military, Vice President Joe Biden said Saturday in an address to the Human Rights Campaign National Dinner that there is no longer “any question” transgender people can openly serve.

“No longer is there any question transgender people are able to serve in the United States military,” declared Biden in front of a large group of LGBT activists.
