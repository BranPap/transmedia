Chaz Bono Complains About Judges' Comments on 'Dancing with the Stars'

Chaz Bono took plenty of heat simply for showing up on ABC’s ‘Dancing with the Stars.’ Now, the program’s first transgender hoofer is none too pleased with how he was treated during his stay on the smash reality series.

Bono, son of singing icon Cher, told ‘Good Morning America’ he felt the judges got too personal during his final appearances on the show.




“I was called a basketball, a penguin, an Ewok, and I just didn’t appreciate it … If you want to critique my dancing  and give me some constructive advice so I can try to improve the next  time that I’m there, that would be great.”




“But I don’t really know how to be less penguish, and so I kind of took offense to that.”

Let’s hope Bono decides against following in his mother’s career footsteps. We hear ‘The X Factor’s’ Simon Cowell can be pretty unflinching with his own judgments.
