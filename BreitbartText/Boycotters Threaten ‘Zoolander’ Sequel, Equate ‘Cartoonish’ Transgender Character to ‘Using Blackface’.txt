Boycotters Threaten ‘Zoolander’ Sequel, Equate ‘Cartoonish’ Transgender Character to ‘Using Blackface’

An online petition is urging moviegoers to boycott the upcoming Ben Stiller comedy Zoolander 2, arguing that the film’s portrayal of a transgender model is the “equivalent of using blackface.”

A trailer for the Zoolander sequel dropped this week. Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch joins returning stars Stiller and Owen Wilson as a gender non-conforming model named “All” in the film.



A petition launched by Sarah Rose urges a boycott of the Paramount film and alleges that Cumberbatch’s portrayal of a trans character “endorses harmful and dangerous perceptions of the queer community at large.”

As of Saturday afternoon, more than 7,000 people have signed the petition.

Zoolander 2 will debut in February.
