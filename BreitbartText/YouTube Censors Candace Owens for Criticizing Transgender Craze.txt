YouTube Censors Candace Owens for Criticizing Transgender Craze

Candace Owens blasted Google-owned YouTube yesterday for removing an episode of her show focused on the left’s attempt to distort the meaning of gender.

PragerU, which hosts the Candace Owens show, confirmed that the video had been deleted by YouTube.

“More censorship: today, YouTube completely removed our episode of the Candace Owens show featuring guest Michael J. Knowles for ‘hate speech’,” said PragerU’s official Twitter account.

PragerU said that a second video by Owens, featuring Wall Street Journal writer Abigail Shrier, was also taken down by YouTube. Shrier is the author of Irreversible Damage, a book criticizing the harms caused by the transgender movement.

The book was briefly removed from sale at Target at the behest of left-wing activists, although it was quickly reinstated. Amazon, while it continues to sell the book, blocked the publisher, Regnery, from running a paid ad to promote it.

Owens scathingly criticized the Silicon Valley tech giant in a comment.

YouTube removed an entire episode of the Candace Owens show because we said that men are not women, and women are not men. I honestly cannot even believe how absolutely batshit woke you have to be to believe basic truth to be “hate speech,” said Owens on Twitter.

“YouTube, you are outrageous.”
