Family Research Council Shooter Worked with LGBT Group

The gunman who opened fire and shot a security guard at the Family Research Council’s Washington, D.C. office has now been identified as Floyd Corkins, a volunteer for the last six months at The DC Center for the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual, Transgender) Community.

Corkins allegedly made negative comments about the FRC before shooting the guard and could have intended to shoot FRC employees had the security guard not heroically intervened.

This label is not without consequences. For instance, on Tuesday, the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organization, ran a story on a blog about Paul Ryan’s appearance next month at the Values Voters summit, which is sponsored by the FRC, titled, “Paul Ryan Speaking at Hate Group’s Annual Conference.” 

And yet, the SPLC released a rather tepid statement in which there was no expression of concern whatsoever about the well-being of the security guard who is allegedly in stable condition after being shot. 

We’ve seen news of the shooting of a security guard today at the Family Research Council office in Washington, D.C., and are getting media inquiries about it. There are unconfirmed reports that the shooting was ideologically motivated. We condemn all acts of violence and are following the story closely.
