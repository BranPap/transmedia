Nightclub Hosts Teen Drag Performance to Fund LGBT Agenda in Schools, Tickets Sell Out

A nightclub in Wisconsin hosted a drag performance from at least one teenager and boasted that tickets for the event sold out. Proceeds from the event went to a local organization that works to embed gender theory into our education system. 

Five Nightclub in Madison, Wisconsin, hosted a drag show that featured at least one teen drag performance among its six drag queens. Some of the performers at the event use stage names such as “MettahDroid,” “Dee Dee Purr,” and “Nemo.”

The advertisement for the event noted “all ages welcome.” It also said that proceeds from the tickets were sold out, and that the proceeds are going to an organization called “GSafe.” The organization is specifically dedicated to embedding leftist gender theory into K-12 schools. 

It also says “The staff at GSAFE has also put together a couple of terminology resources for educators to help them teach their students, co-workers, and the community the preferred terminology within the LGBTQ+ community.”

The nightclub’s website notes that it “provides a very mixed crowd…the younger…the older…the gays and the straights…playing in one arena!” The nightclub also calls itself the “home of Madison’s Sunday night MadCity Drag Revue shows, charity events, annual drag pageants, and sexy male dance revues.”
