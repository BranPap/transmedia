Exclusive — John McEntee on ‘The Right Stuff’: ‘Political Affiliation’ Has Displaced ‘Religion’ as ‘Biggest Deal Breaker’ in Dating

John McEntee, former director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office during the Trump administration and founder and CEO of The Right Stuff, said on Thursday’s edition of Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow that politics has displaced religion as the primary “deal breaker” in dating.

McEntee said his conception and creation of The Right Stuff came as a response to existing dating apps being dominated by partisan Democrat politics.



The Right Stuff, McEntee added, may consolidate conservatives looking to date like-minded persons onto one platform.

He said, “Conservatives are spread out on a lot of different platforms. We want to consolidate that. Right now, conservatives have to hide their views on these platforms because of the hostility they face, so it’s even harder to find each other. So we want a place where you can be yourself openly, where everyone at least has this one major thing in common.”

“They want to go out with other normal people,” McEntee concluded, “have fun, be allowed to laugh, and just live a happy life.”

The Right Stuff is now available for download on Apple’s App Store.

Tinder, one of the largest dating apps, introduced “new genders” on its platform in 2016 after partnering with left-wing political organizations such as GLAAD. Its YouTube channel includes videos providing the company’s framing of political neologisms such as “non-binary,” “demisexual,” and “trans” as part of its “Tinder Inclusivity” campaign.
