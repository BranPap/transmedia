Obama Transgender Policy Continues in Texas Illegal Alien Detention Center

In another effort by President Obama to cater to the small percent of individuals who identify on a given day as transgender, an illegal alien detention center in Texas will now designate 5.1 percent of their beds to those who so self-identify. This is despite the fact that the federal government’s own numbers report only 0.2 percent of illegal aliens identify themselves as transgender.

These percentages were first noted in a Hotair.com article entitled, “Super. We’re building separate detention facilities for transgender illegal immigrants.”

The International Business Times reported in July that the U.S. has about 31,000 immigrants in detention on a daily basis. ICE officials reported that approximately 65 of the illegal aliens detained are transgender.They are more likely to be the victim of a sexual assault, the publication also reported.

Only one other federal illegal alien detention center has had a transgender unit. It is located in Santa Ana, California. As reported on Breitbart News on May 23, the facility held 28 transgender individuals last week.

The “Transgender Care Memorandum” serving as guidance for the new policy provides that ERO officers will determine if a particular facility is appropriate for housing a transgender individual. ERO Law Enforcement Systems and Analysis (LESA) workers were also instructed to remove the word “gender” from its data systems and to include only “Male,” “Female,” “Intersex,” or “Unknown.”

The Prairieland Detention Center will be located ten miles south of Fort Worth and thirty-five miles southwest of Dallas.
