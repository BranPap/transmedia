The Obama Doctrine: Trading Bullets for Sex-Change Hormones in Afghanistan

A female solider is taking the name “Keith” as she begins the hormone treatment necessary to complete her sex change.

The soldier, who says she’s been married to another woman for two years, is currently deployed to Afghanistan.

In fact, because of “Keith’s” story, some groups are arguing that the repeal of DADT did not go far enough. They claim the military now needs to change its rules for “transgender people,” so that they too can serve honorably and openly. 

Welcome to war-fighting under the Obama doctrine.
