'House of Cards,' 'Orange Is the New Black' Shut Out on Emmy Night

The Netflix series House of Cards put the streaming giant in the content big leagues, right alongside HBO, AMC and FX. Orange Is the New Black showed Netflix was no fluke in the original programming arena.

Yet both the political drama and prison dramedy coudn’t land a single Emmy during Monday night’s awards telecast.

Following the Creative Arts ceremony, Orange Is the New Black looked like the new front-runner in the comedy categories, but it lost all of its remaining primetime prizes, including best actress in a comedy series (Taylor Schilling), best supporting actress in a comedy series (Kate Mulgrew) and best comedy series, which The Hollywood Reporter’s chief TV critic Tim Goodman predicted the show would win….

Netflix went into this year’s ceremony with 31 nominations, including 13 for its signature drama House of Cards. House of Cards also lost many of the big awards Monday night, including best actor (Kevin Spacey) and actress (Robin Wright) in a drama series and best drama series. The show was up for best writing and directing for a drama series, as well.

Cards has won kudos both for being relatively bipartisan in nature and for drawing some of film’s biggest talents, including Kevin Spacey and director David Fincher. Orange quickly became a buzzed about smash, earning acclaim for the work of Laverne Cox, a transgender actress.
