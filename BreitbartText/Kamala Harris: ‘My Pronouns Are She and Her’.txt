Kamala Harris: ‘My Pronouns Are She and Her’

Vice President Kamala Harris welcomed gay and transgender activists into her ceremonial office on Wednesday, expressing her preferred pronouns during her remarks.

Harris spoke in front of a placard that put her preferred pronouns after her name.

“You are the voices of so many who probably never have walked into this room, and over the course of time probably weren’t thought to be invited into this room,” she said.

Harris spoke about the attack on transgender youth in the United States, including Republican-led attempts to prevent biological males from competing in women’s sports.

Not having transgender members of the military "undermines our national security," explained Biden deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. https://t.co/7SE2WQXEnt

She said there were 250 proposed bills across the country that were anti-gay and anti-transgender, “including prohibiting transgender youth from receiving medical care and participating in sports, the prohibition on transgender people using the restroom, voter rights.”

Harris also noted under President Joe Biden the Department of Veterans Affairs would now cover the costs of “gender confirmation surgeries” of veterans and military service people.

“We’ve come a long way and there’s still so much work to get done,” she said.
