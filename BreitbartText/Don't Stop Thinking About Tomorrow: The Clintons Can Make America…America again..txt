Don't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow: The Clintons Can Make America…America again.

In the wake of the 2012 Presidential election, conservatives found themselves in an existential abyss where their only company was the internal whisper of a solitary but very alarming question: Is the America we knew and loved gone forever? 

Some might say “yes.” Some might say the rapid cultural departure from the values we used to hold so dear is an indication of a nation whose best days are behind her.  The appreciation for the charm and simplicity of daily American life is gone…replaced with 140 characters and a Transgender Homecoming Queen. Some might “yes.” It’s gone. 

We must look back to see our future, which is why I’m taking another look at the Clintons who many believe will be the next occupants of the White House. If the Clintons return to the White House maybe our nation can return to the days when America felt good about itself…when optimism and pride were held in high regard…when leadership prevailed…and prosperity flourished. 

And speaking of flourishing, in a recent interview with the Daily Mail, Bill Clinton’s former mistress, Gennifer Flowers, claimed that Hillary Clinton was bisexual: “I just know what Bill told me and that was that he was aware that Hillary was bisexual and he didn’t care. He should know. He said Hillary had eaten more pussy than he had.”
