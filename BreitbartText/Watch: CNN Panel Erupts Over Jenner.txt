Watch: CNN Panel Erupts Over Jenner

During Tuesday’s “CNN Tonight,” host Don Lemon found himself in a war of words with three panelists while discussing the newly-named Caitlyn Jenner. Jenner, an Olympian, was recently named the 2015 “Arthur Ashe Courage Award” winner and will receive the award during this year’s ESPYs.

Tur opened the debate, questioning the intentions of Jenner, saying, “What we’re seeing is rollout of a product. It is a continuation of the Kardashian line.”

Then, quoting her mother, “What’s next? Black people, we’re going to all of a sudden start bleaching our skin because we don’t like being black?”

“What does that have to do with being trans?” Lemon shouted. “That has nothing to do with being trans!”

“I think real courage is not trying to make money, millions of dollars off of coming out and changing your gender,” declared Wright. “What Bruce Jenner is doing, and Caitlyn, is not real courage.”

Zur later said Wright was “obviously a narcissist” for her arguments during the debate.
