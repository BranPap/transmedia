Female Swimmer Says She Felt ‘Extreme Discomfort’ Sharing Locker Room with Lia Thomas

A former NCAA swimmer who competed against Lia Thomas says she experienced “extreme discomfort” while sharing a locker room with the transgender swimmer.

“That’s not something we were forewarned about, which I don’t think is right in any means, changing in a locker room with someone who has different parts,” Gaines said on Tucker Carlson Today.

“So not only were we forced to race against a male, we were forced to change in the locker room with one,” Gaines said.

“Then we’re sitting there not even knowing who to talk to, who to complain to, because this kind of all happened behind the scenes and very discreetly.”

Gaines leveled the charge that the NCAA had failed to secure and defend the integrity of women’s sports.

Earlier this year, FINA, the international swimming governing body, effectively banned transgender swimmers from women’s sports by instituting a policy where only athletes who transitioned before the age of 12 would be allowed to compete.

This week, the NCAA denied the University of Pennsylvania’s nomination of Thomas as “Woman of the Year.”
