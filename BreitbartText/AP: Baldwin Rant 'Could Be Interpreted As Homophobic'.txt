AP: Baldwin Rant 'Could Be Interpreted As Homophobic'



Alec Baldwin has apologized to a New York City-based lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights group for a series of tweets that could be interpreted as homophobic.

“Could be interpreted”???

The geniuses at the Associated Press didn’t go so far as to provide their readers with an alternate interpretation of “Queen” when referring to a gay man in a hostile and threatening manner.  However, a good faith search of the AP style book failed to discover an acceptable usage for the term in this context.
