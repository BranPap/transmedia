Elliot Page, ‘Matrix’ Director Lilly Wachowski Back ACLU Lawsuit Protecting Sex Change Operations for Transgender Children

An ACLU lawsuit attempting to block an Arkansas law concerning transgender children has picked up support from prominent Hollywood celebrities, including Elliot Page — the star formerly known as Ellen Page — as well as filmmaker Lilly Wachowski and reality TV star Jazz Jennings.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) vetoed the law last year but the Arkansas legislature overrode the veto. But before it could take effect, the ACLU filed a lawsuit to halt the legislation, claiming such “gender affirming” procedures for kids qualify as “medically necessary health care.”

Others joining the suit include dozens of academics, transgender activists, and physicians.

“These bills are going to be responsible for the death of children. It is that simple,” Page said.

Lilly Wachowski is one of the filmmaking siblings behind The Matrix movies. Both siblings were born male and have since declared themselves to be transgender women.

Jazz Jennings is the star of the TLC reality series I Am Jazz, which chronicled the teenager’s transgender journey.
