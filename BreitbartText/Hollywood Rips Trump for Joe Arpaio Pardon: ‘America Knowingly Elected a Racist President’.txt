Hollywood Rips Trump for Joe Arpaio Pardon: ‘America Knowingly Elected a Racist President’

Several celebrities took to social media late Friday and slammed President Donald Trump for pardoning Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted in July of violating a federal court order not to detain suspected illegal immigrants.

DT, not to be upstaged by an act of God,announces future ban of transgenders from military & pardons Arpaio. DT-a truly hateful human being.

With the pardoning of Joe Arpaio, Donald Trump has solidified his place in U.S. history. America knowingly elected a racist president.
