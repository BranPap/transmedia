Nepal Court Orders Passport Change for Transgenders

Nepal’s Supreme Court has ordered the government to alter passports so that transgenders no longer have to describe themselves as male or female, a court spokesman said, a move welcomed by rights activists.

The court made the decision on Monday following a petition from a transgender who wanted a third category introduced on passports for people who identify themselves neither as male nor female, the spokesman said.

Early this year, Nepal introduced a transgender category for people obtaining their citizenship certificates. People can register as a “third gender” when completing the certificates, which serve as national identity cards required to open bank accounts, sell and buy property and get a passport.

Sunil Babu Pant, director of the Blue Diamond Society, a gay rights group, welcomed the court’s decision.
