The clip has been widely criticized on Twitter, with some users posting screenshots to show that they had unsubscribed from Ulta Beauty’s email advertisements and others saying that they will boycott the store following their promotion of transgenderism. 

During the full length clip on YouTube, Mulvaney criticized women who opposed his stereotypical representation of femininity. “I think in womanhood I get shamed a lot for liking pink and liking glitter, and I’m like — Why does that bother you so much? They think I’m lowering their standard of being a woman.” Mulvaney said, to which David Lopez replied, “Misogyny. Patriarchy,” Mulvaney remarked. 

We want our channel to be welcoming to people from all walks of life—even people you may not agree with.

Reduxx reported that Ulta Beauty also hid comments from those that opposed the company giving a platform to a man to discuss girlhood and motherhood. The outlet also noted that Mulvaney had risen to prominence after launching his “days of girlhood” TikTok videos, which often feature him acting stereotypically feminine.
