Fired Transgendered Model: ‘All White People Benefit from Racism’

The transgendered model who was fired by L’Oréal Paris UK has stood by their online comments about the “violent” white “race”, claiming, “all white people benefit from racism”.

“I believe that society is built on the foundation of colonialism and slavery… I’m not saying that all white people are guilty of it [racism] but all white people benefit from racism [through] white privilege.”

Bergdoff was made the makeup and hair product brand’s first ever transgendered ambassador and hailed the new “face of modern diversity” last week.

The “transgender woman of colour” was fired by the UK branch of the cosmetic company after their comments came to light on social media.

Adding: “Come see me when you realise that racism isn’t learned, it’s inherited and consciously or unconsciously passed down through privilege.

“Once white people begin to admit that their race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth… then we can talk.

“Until then stay acting shocked about how the world continues to stay fucked at the hands of your ancestors and your heads that remain buried in the sand with hands over your ears.”

In a later post defending the comments, Bergdorf added: “The irony of all this is that L’Oréal Paris invited me to be part of a beauty campaign that ‘stands for diversity’,” and demanded L’Oréal Paris be boycotted.
