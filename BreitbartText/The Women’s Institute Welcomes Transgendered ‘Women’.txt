The Women’s Institute Welcomes Transgendered ‘Women’

The Women’s Institute (WI) celebrated their 100th anniversary yesterday, and my, what a lot has changed over the century. The group, founded on the principle of bringing women together by excluding men, has revealed it now accepts men, as long as they identify as women.

One of the WI members in the audience, Diana, of the Somersham group in the Huntington and Peterborough registry, said she had been a member of the organisation for two years.

Diana told the presenters that she had joined because, “I thought I could add more to the community by joining, and also find a new group of friends which I certainly have done. I myself try to assist younger members, when they want to start their own businesses and other business opportunities.

“I think it’s a great thing for the girls to take forward their ideas and make them into a profitable business.”

Adding: “We’re very very lucky we’ve got some lively girls there, and yes it’s a whole community.”

However, according to Reddit users in the Transgender discussion group, this information has been publicly available for some time. Two years, in fact, when Diana joined. The WI was e-mailed by a mystery transgendered person asking whether or not they could join. The WI replied:

“Any person who is living their life a women is very welcome to join the WI, and to participate in any WI activities in the same way as any other women.”

“Nice one!” replied Reddit user Grown and Out; “I’ve been told the WI are pretty progressive so I’m not surprised, but still pleased.”
