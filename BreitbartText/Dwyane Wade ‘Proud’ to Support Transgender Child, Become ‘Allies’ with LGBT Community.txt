Dwyane Wade ‘Proud’ to Support Transgender Child, Become ‘Allies’ with LGBT Community

Former NBA star Dwyane Wade has announced his support for his son, who now claims to be a transgender girl.

“Me and my wife, my wife Gabrielle Union…we are proud parents of a child in the LGBTQ+ community, and we’re proud allies as well,” Wade told DeGeneres on her Tuesday broadcast. “We take our roles and responsibility as parents very seriously.”

“Zion, born as a boy, came home and said, ‘Hey, so I want to talk to you guys. I think going forward, I am ready to live my truth. I want to be referenced as ‘she’ and ‘her.’ I would love for you guys to call me Zaya,'” Wade said.

“When our child comes home with a question, when our child comes home with an issue, when our child comes home with anything, it’s our job as parents to listen to that, to give them the best information that we can, the best feedback that we can,” Wade added. “And that doesn’t change because sexuality is now involved in it.”

Wade said that he and his wife are now working on getting as informed as possible on transgender issues.

Wade’s actress wife, Gabrielle Union, took to Twitter to introduce “Zaya.”

In the video Union added to her tweet, the 12-year-old is heard telling Wade, “You gotta just push through, I mean it’s worth it, I feel like it’s very worth it, when you reach that point of like, yourself.”

Meet Zaya. She's compassionate, loving, whip smart and we are so proud of her. It’s Ok to listen to, love & respect your children exactly as they are. Love and light good people. pic.twitter.com/G2lLVdD2VT
