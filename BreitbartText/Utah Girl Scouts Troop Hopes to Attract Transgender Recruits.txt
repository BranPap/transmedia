Utah Girl Scouts Troop Hopes to Attract Transgender Recruits

The Girl Scouts are concerned about falling membership and a declining number of adult volunteers, so a Girl Scout staffer in Salt Lake City cooked up the idea to start a troop headquartered in the area’s “gay pride center.”

The idea is to attract “transgender” youth and children living with an LGBT parent.

The troop had its first meeting Monday with five girls. No transgender youth have joined yet but hopes are high.

Girl Scout spokesman Josh Ackley told the AP there are no prohibitions on LGBT leaders in the Girl Scouts USA. Breitbart News profiled Ackley last year as a “homopunk” rocker who makes music videos showing violence against women. Ackley said boys who identify as girls are accepted in the Girl Scouts nationally.

Ongoing connections between the Girl Scouts and abortion providers has likely not helped membership either.

Last year, pro-lifers launched a national cookie boycott because of the Girl Scout’s promotion of Wendy Davis, pro-abortion candidate for governor of Texas.
