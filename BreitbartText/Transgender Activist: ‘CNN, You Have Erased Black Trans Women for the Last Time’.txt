Transgender Activist: ‘CNN, You Have Erased Black Trans Women for the Last Time’

A black transgender activist interrupted a question and took the microphone on Thursday night’s CNN Equality Town Hall, where the individual claimed CNN had “erased black trans women.”

“I don’t want to take this away from you, but let me tell you something,” the activist said while taking the microphone during an audience question. “Black trans women are being killed in this country, and, CNN, you have erased black trans women for the last time.”

The activist identified herself as Blossom when CNN host Don Lemon stepped in to de-escalate the situation.

“The reason that we are here is to validate people like you,” Lemon told Blossom. “That is why we are here.”

As Blossom gave the microphone back to Lemon, he said, “we want to hear from you.”

Blossom then spoke about “anti-blackness” and pleaded for the “opportunity” to be heard.
