Popular Author: Men ‘Transition’ into Women for ‘Frivolous Reasons Like Fashion or Clothes’

A prominent author has said some men who “transition” into women do it for frivolous reasons, as well as because women are increasing powerful in today’s society.

However, he insists she does not intend to offend anyone and says she supports transgendered people who make the change for “serious” reasons.

“Most of them being men wanting to be women – the women who want to be men have a really hard time I think, because it’s a real serious business for them. I’m not dismissing this at all.”

When asked if she recognised that her comments could “offend a lot of transgender people”, she insisted: “I’m not offending transgender people or thinking there’s anything wrong with that.”

“I’ve written a comic novel about somebody who is a frivolous person who does it frivolously. Then you have to read it to see what happens,” she said.

“But I am not offending transgender people or thinking there is anything wrong with changing your gender, because I don’t. I think it is something very personal, but you can’t not say what you think, what you see with your eyes.’

She added that she “tends to see women as the oppressive force at the moment”.

In recent years transgender ideology has gained huge mainstream support in the UK.

The taxpayer-funded National Health Service (NHS) increased its budget for “treating” the transgendered to £22.72 million in 2015, up from £17.13 million the year before.

And at the beginning of last year, a parliamentary enquiry demanded that teaching and accommodating for transgenderism be “mandatory” in schools, and teenagers be able to change their gender against the will of their parents.
