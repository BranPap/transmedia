U.S. Bishops Slam New HHS Regulations Affecting Gender Reassignment

ROME — The U.S. bishops’ conference (USCCB) warned this week new HHS regulations mandating harmful surgical procedures are “a violation of religious freedom and bad medicine.”

“Sadly, Monday’s proposed regulations threaten our ability to carry out our healing ministries, and others’ to practice medicine,” reads a joint statement issued by Baltimore Archbishop William Lori, chair of the Bishops’ Committee on Pro-Life Activities, Oklahoma City Archbishop Paul Coakley, chair of the Committee on Domestic Justice and Human Development, San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, chairman of the Committee on Laity, Marriage, Family Life and Youth, and New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, chairman of the Committee for Religious Liberty.

“This is a violation of religious freedom and bad medicine,” they add.

“The proposed regulations announce that HHS is also considering whether to force health care workers to perform abortions against their will or lose their jobs. We call on HHS to explicitly disavow any such intent,” they write.

The bishops also underscore the Catholic Church discriminates against no one in providing health care and Catholic health care ministries “serve everyone, no matter their race, sex, belief system, or any other characteristic.”

“The same excellent care will be provided in a Catholic hospital to all patients, including patients who identify as transgender, whether it be for a broken bone or for cancer, but we cannot do what our faith forbids,” they declare, adding that we “object to harmful procedures, not to patients.”
