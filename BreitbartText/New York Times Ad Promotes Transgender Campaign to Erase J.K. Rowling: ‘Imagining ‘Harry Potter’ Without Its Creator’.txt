New York Times Ad Promotes Transgender Campaign to Erase J.K. Rowling: ‘Imagining ‘Harry Potter’ Without Its Creator’

A new advertising campaign by the New York Times is embracing the transgender community’s ongoing attacks on author J.K. Rowling by spotlighting a subscriber named “Lianna” who would like to see Rowling erased from the Harry Potter canon.

In one of the ads, “Lianna” — who appears to be transgender or gender non-binary — engages in a free association of thoughts and ideas, which include “breaking the [gender] binary,” spending a “week in crossword land,” and “imagining Harry Potter without its creator.”



The Times is reportedly running the ads in major cities, including Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Atlanta. A version of the “Lianna” ad appeared in the D.C. Metro system, including the attack on Rowling.

There was a video ad in the DC subway today. I am going to post some stills from this ad, and you will try to guess what company is advertising. Fourth photo is the reveal.

“I know and love trans people, but erasing the concept of sex removes the ability of many to meaningfully discuss their lives. It isn’t hate to speak the truth,” she tweeted.

As a result of her views, Hollywood has ostracized Rowling. The author has stated transgender activists have doxxed her and her family, and have sent her violent threats.

The New York Times ad has provoked heated debate on social media. Among the dissenters is acclaimed novelist Joyce Carol Oates, who blasted the newspaper for its “shocking condescension.”

shocking condescension. we are trying to imagine the N Y Times without its marketing dept., without its editors, without its owners, without its Op-Ed columnists & without its loyal subscriber base. https://t.co/r7oTAkafSe
