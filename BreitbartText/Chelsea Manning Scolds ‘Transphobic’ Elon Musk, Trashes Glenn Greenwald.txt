Chelsea Manning Scolds ‘Transphobic’ Elon Musk, Trashes Glenn Greenwald

Famed intelligence leaker Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Bradley before he identified as female, scolded billionaire Elon Musk for his alleged transphobia while trashing her former friend and ally Glenn Greenwald for cozying up to right-wing pundits.

“Netflix waiting for the war to end to make a movie about a black Ukraine guy [who] falls in love with a transgender soldier,” Musk tweeted at the time.

Friendships that depend on political agreement were never ‘friendships,’ just cynical transactions. When she was in prison trying repeatedly to kill herself, I was one of the only one who visited, spent hours on the phone, raising money for her. No good deed goes unpunished.

Anyway, sometimes people are nice to you as long as you’re of use to them and provide them things they want, then turn on you when you can’t or won’t any longer. As long as you know you gave and defended them with the right motives — as I did — your conscience should clean.

Manning also disavowed Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in that same year, saying that he would have leaked the 750,000 classified and unclassified documents to journalist Ken Klippenstein.

Speaking with the Daily Beast, Manning added that Greenwald has aligned with “dangerous” people.
