Transgender ABC Newsman Switches Back to Straight Male

On Monday, ABC News editor Don Ennis announced that he was no longer a woman trapped in a man’s body; now he was a man trapped in a woman’s body that used to be a man’s body. According to Ennis, he underwent two days of amnesia, and woke up in an odd situation: “I accused my wife of playing some kind of cruel joke, dressing me up in a wig and bra and making fake ID’s with the name ‘Dawn’ on it. Seriously…It became obvious this was not the case once I took off the bra – and discovered two reasons I was wearing one.” Ennis had undergone hormone therapy resulting in him growing breasts. 

Ellis said that his three-month transformation into Dawn was a “tremendous gift.”

He added, “The new change I’m revealing to you today did not arise because I couldn’t hack it, or people wouldn’t accept the new/real/female ‘me,’ or I had trouble finding shoes that fit (Oh, I found plenty, more than I could afford)…Even my beloved, who had encouraged me to be true to myself at the expense of our marriage, had finally accepted my new identity.”
