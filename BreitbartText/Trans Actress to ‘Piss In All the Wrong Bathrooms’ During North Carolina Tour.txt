Trans Actress to ‘Piss In All the Wrong Bathrooms’ During North Carolina Tour

A transgender actress and activist preparing to embark on a traveling performance tour of North Carolina plans to take photos of herself urinating “in all the wrong bathrooms” to protest the state’s recent passage of what critics have called an anti-LGBT bathroom law.

“They are trying to create a situation where trans people are supposed to be invisible,” the New York City-based artist told the Guardian this week. “This is an absurd, panicked reaction from the ignorant, it’s a massive step backwards, so I felt it was my duty to go down there and take selfies in as many men’s bathrooms as possible.”

Nayfack reportedly got the idea to crowd-fund the tour based on a previous successful crowdfunding campaign that financed her gender reassignment surgery in Thailand last year.

“[A]s a grassroots trans activist and, God willing, a rising star in the entertainment industry – I can slip in there and make a stand and motivate the people who are dealing with the consequences of this.”

Nayfack is reportedly considering hiring security guards to stand outside the men’s rooms, so as to avoid any physical altercations.

Nayfack’s Manifest Pussy tour is scheduled to begin June 9 in Brooklyn, New York.

Earlier this year, the actress joined the cast of the hit Amy Poehler-produced Hulu series Difficult People.

A number of high-profile entertainers, including Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr and the rock band Pearl Jam, have cancelled concerts in North Carolina to protest the state’s bathroom law.
