Catholic League: Biden’s Transgender Policy Promotes ‘Child Abuse’

Catholic League president Bill Donohue said Wednesday that President Joe Biden’s new policy for transgender youth exposes them to serious health risks and constitutes “child abuse.”

The executive order describes these state laws as “harmful and discriminatory legislative attacks on LGBTQI+ children, Youth, and Families” and instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to use the department’s authorities “to protect LGBTQI+ individuals’ access to medically necessary care from harmful state and local laws and practices.”

Donohue cites an important Swedish study that found that over the course of the 30-year period from 1973 to 2003, individuals who had undergone sex reassignment surgery had “considerably higher risks for mortality, suicidal behavior, and psychiatric morbidity than the general population.”

“The suicide rate among those who undergo surgery to change their sex is 20 times higher than those who do not,” Donohue continued, while another study found that minors who “transition” to the opposite sex without parental consent are associated with “higher risk of suicide.”

“There needs to be a national moratorium on the pernicious practice of allowing children to switch their nature-assigned sex,” Donohue proposed as an alternative to executive activism meant to strongarm states into accepting dangerous medical practices for children.

Conditioning children to believe a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is “child abuse,” the physicians declared.

In Wednesday’s essay, Donohue warned that adults who counsel children to consider changing their sex or otherwise facilitate sex-reassignment surgery — complete with hormone blockers and genital mutilation — “are a threat to their psychological and physiological well-being. This is child abuse.”

“Astonishingly, President Biden is leading the way,” he concluded.
