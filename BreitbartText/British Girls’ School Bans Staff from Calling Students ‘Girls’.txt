British Girls’ School Bans Staff from Calling Students ‘Girls’

The Altrincham Grammar School for Girls in the United Kingdom has officially banned its teacher from addressing its students as “girls.”

Altrincham Grammar for Girls sent out a letter last week informing student’s parents that teachers would officially be prohibited from referring to their students as “girls.”

In an interview with the BBC, a local resident condemned the decision. “It’s ridiculous. We live in an age where we have to respect people’s views and if people have issues around gender and sexuality we have to understand that. But girls should be referred to as girls,” the resident said.

“It’s important our students feel comfortable and able to bring their true selves to the learning environment,” the school said. “We welcome and celebrate diversity at our school and we will look at any measure, however small, to ensure the wellbeing of our staff and students.”
