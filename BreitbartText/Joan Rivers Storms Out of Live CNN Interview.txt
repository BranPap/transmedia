Joan Rivers Storms Out of Live CNN Interview

Rivers angrily began ranting about the hypocrisy of criticizing fur when everyone eats chicken and wears leather belts before abruptly ending the interview saying, “You’re not the one to interview a person who denies humor,” and storming off the set.

Rivers has come under fire this week for joking to a photographer that President Barack Obama is gay and first lady Michelle Obama is transgender.
