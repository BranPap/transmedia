San Diego Mayor Zip Lines Over 'Gotham City' at Comic-Con



City Council President Todd Gloria accompanied Mayor Faulconer on a parallel zip line. Both men took off for the 200-foot adventure at precisely 9:30 am, according to local Fox News affiliate in San Diego Fox 5.

After a few reporters observed the successful landing of Mayor Faulconer and Mr. Gloria, one reporter confirmed, “It has officially started. Comic-Con is now underway.” 

Also being celebrated was the launch of a new Mike Tyson series which is to be featured on Adult Swim this fall. The series is called “Mike Tyson Mysteries.” In it, a cartoon version of Tyson teams up with a pigeon to solve cases, reports the Associated Press. 

The convention also featured a panel on transgender issues in the comic book industry. Comic-Con will be running between July 24-27.
