Kelly Osbourne Wants to 'Retire' Another Word

When Kelly Osbourne speaks, the culture changes.

That’s what the daughter of heavy metal legend Ozzy Osbourne is hoping, anyway, with her new piece at The Huffington Post. Seems Ms. Osbourne recently used the “T” word – tranny – and knows how much pain and suffering her utterance caused.

Not only will she never use the word again, she wants us all to rise up and join her:


The word “tr*nny” is a derogatory and hurtful word. I was completely  ignorant to this and soon came to realize most of my peers and LGBT  friends are, too. This is a word I will no longer use or allow. It  wasn’t until I googled it after speaking with GLAAD that I found out  just how unbelievably offensive it was …



A part of me is happy I’ve made such an awful mistake, because I can now  use this as a platform to help speak out against the use of such  hurtful and dehumanizing words. With your assistance and support, we can  get this word out of television/media.  It is still being used today;  I’ve seen it four times in the past week.

Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.
