South Dakota Gov. Vetoes Bill to Keep Girls’ and Boys’ Bathrooms Separate

On Tuesday, the Republican Governor of South Dakota became the latest policy maker to fall for the canard of “gender identity.” Gov. Dennis Daugaard vetoed a bill that would have required boys and girls to use the bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond to their biological sex.


The bill, passed by the South Dakota House of Representatives, would not have allowed schoolboys in dresses to use the girl’s bathroom or locker rooms and showers.

“Gender identity” is one of the latest ideologies promoted by a constellation of transsexual activists, the media, professional medical guilds, and policy makers. The idea is that people are not born male or female but are “assigned” a sex at birth, usually based on genitalia. Advocates of the gender ideology insist that sex is a social construct, as is gender, and that people can change their minds and the government and private businesses must adhere to the person’s new “gender identity.”

Skirmishes have occurred all over the country, as local municipalities and school districts have tried to protect themselves from the new ideology.
