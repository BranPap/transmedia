REPORT: Bruce Jenner Recovering from Breast Implant Surgery

Bruce Jenner’s transition to female is reportedly getting serious. According to a report from RadarOnline, the former AP Male Athlete of the Year has undergone breast implant surgery and is in recovery.

“Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,” a person close to the Jenner family told the entertainment and gossip site. “He went with a smaller implant because he didn’t want to look ridiculous.”

“Recovery hasn’t been that difficult, but Bruce has had to sleep in a recliner to help with the healing,” the source said. “He’s not allowed to lift anything, and he has to wear a bra 24/7, but he’s expected to resume normal activities in the next six weeks.”

According to Radar, the Olympic athlete-turned reality TV star had breast implants inserted earlier in March, to coincide with other procedures in recent months, including a chondrolaryngoplasty to shave down his Adam’s apple, and a rhinoplasty (nose job) in order to appear more feminine.

The rumor mill is churning with ideas as to how Jenner will make his public debut as a woman. ABC’s Dancing With The Stars is reputedly interested in providing the venue, while an unnamed source claims it has been a lifelong dream of Jenner to grace the cover of Vogue magazine… as a glamorous female model.

Speculation appeared to be confirmed in January. A source close to the Jenner family told People Magazine: “Bruce is transitioning to a woman.”

“He is finally happy and his family is accepting of what he’s doing. He’s in such a great space. That’s why it’s the perfect time to do something like this,” the person said.
