Transgender Teacher Claims $60k After Co-Workers Use Wrong Pronoun

A transgender school teacher has been given a payout of $60,000 after complaining of being harassed by colleagues for over a year who allegedly “misgendered” her, despite an official investigation stating otherwise.

Leo Soell, who works as a fifth grade teacher at Gresham-Barlow school in Oregon, submitted a complaint to Oregon district officials that she had been “harassed” by colleagues after coming out as transgender last September.

Officials have refused to release the investigation’s findings publicly but have confirmed that they did not find any evidence of wrongdoing.

However, despite the verdict, the school decided to recompense Soell $60,000 on grounds of emotional damages, and district officials have confirmed they will introduce gender-neutral bathrooms in all local schools as a result.

The school’s principal, Heidi Lasher, also emailed staff to instruct that the new policies “require that all staff address transgender or gender non-conforming employees with their correct name and pronouns.”

“If you are found to be in violation of these policies, you will be subject to discipline up to and including dismissal,” she added.
