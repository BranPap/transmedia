Chinese Transgender Teen Drama Gets Green Light from Communist Government

Chinese director Zhang Wei is set to helm The Rib, which follows a transgender teen who struggles to confront a displeased Chinese society and his staunchly Christian family.

Zhang, according to Variety, was grateful to China’s communist government for allowing him to make a movie that “tackles subjects that might have been taboo only a few years ago.” Variety added that he’s “determined to tell this important story despite any roadblocks [he] might face.”

As of 2001, being homosexual is no longer diagnosed as a mental disease. Currently, transgender people in China are classified as suffering from a mental illness. However, sex reassignment surgery is legal in the communist country.

Over the last 30 years, there have been very few Chinese films that feature transgender people. And U.S.-based NGO Asia Catalyst estimates that currently, 9.5 million transgender people are in the Asia-Pacific region.

Zhang is also set to direct the big-budget film Sound of a Dream, which tells the story of four blind children with dreams to be featured on a TV talent show.
