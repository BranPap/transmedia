Transgender Poll: Majority of Americans Against Allowing Men to Compete Against Women

A majority of Americans are against women having to compete against biological men in athletics, a Rasmussen Reports survey released Friday found.

A majority, or 56 percent, said “no,” it is not fair. One-quarter of respondents said “yes,” it is fair, and 19 percent said they are not sure.

A majority of both men and women, 59 percent and 54 percent, respectively, believe it is not fair.

Over half of Americans, 55 percent, indicated they have at least somewhat followed the recent news reports about transgender athletes in the upcoming Olympic games.

The survey’s margin of error is +/- three percent.

“We acknowledge that gender identity in sport is a highly sensitive and complex issue requiring a balance between human rights and fairness on the field of play,” New Zealand Olympic Committee chief Kereyn Smith said in a statement.

“As the New Zealand team, we have a strong culture of manaaki (caring) and inclusion and respect for all,” Smith added.

As Breitbart News reported, Hubbard reportedly kept a minority woman out of the Olympics, 21-year-old Kuinini Manumua:

Totally fair.

Test: explain, precisely, why there are separate categories for men’s & women’s sports? 

Why not just have generic “basketball” & “tennis” & “track” & “weightlifting,” regardless of gender?

If you have a problem with that, explain why, exactly. https://t.co/6CKUQNxSdE
