Bristol University Moves to Cancel the Word ‘Maternity’

A PhD student at Bristol University has claimed that she was accused of being ‘transphobic’ and referred to human resources for saying only biological women can give birth.

The PhD student was also told by another staff member that after removing the words “woman”, “her” and “she” from Bristol University’s maternity policy, those responsible for diversity policies at the university told the staff member that the word “maternity” was “exclusionary” and “problematic”.

Rosario-Sanchez is also taking legal action against the university after they ignored a two year organised campaign of abuse Sanchez experienced from transgender activists after attending feminist meetings that advocated for women-only spaces such as toilets and changing rooms, the Daily Mail reports.

Political commentator Sophie Corcoran told Breitbart that Bristol’s “woke” maternity policy is actually “deeply misogynistic and regressive”.

“Banning of the word ‘maternity, is deeply misogynistic and regressive, these universities that try to be woke and just walking blindfolded in the wrong direction. Maternity is a thing, motherhood is a thing, you can’t just take that away”, Corcoran said.

Bristol University has declined to comment on the case due to the ongoing “legal action”, it was reported.

In a guide released by the university for their academic staff, they suggested replacing “he/she” with “they/them”, and swapping “manpower” with “workforce” and “mankind” with “humankind”.

Manchester University justified this move by saying: “binary gender terms (man/woman, girl/boy) have traditional associations with sex, but we now recognise how some people identify with a gender opposite to that assigned to them as a child (trans) and others identify neither as men nor women (non-binary or genderfluid).”

LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall has also told British schoolteachers that they should remove all “gendered” language from classrooms and refrain from dividing sports by sex, as Breitbart reported in June 2021.

Stonewall also advised schools to allow pupils who believe they are transgender to have complete access to changing rooms, toilets, showers, dormitories and they should decide which one they feel most comfortable in.
