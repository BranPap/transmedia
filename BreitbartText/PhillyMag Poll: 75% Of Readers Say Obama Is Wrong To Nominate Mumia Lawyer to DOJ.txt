PhillyMag Poll: 75% Of Readers Say Obama Is Wrong To Nominate Mumia Lawyer to DOJ

PhillyMag.com has a poll up asking readers if they think Obama was wrong to nominate Debo Adegbile, the former lawyer of cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal, to head the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice.

Reporter Victor Fiorillo notes that “a lot of people are not okay with that”, citing Chuck Canterbury, President of the Fraternal Order of Police, who sent Obama a letter castigating him for the nomination. 

Most legal scholars yes, of course. Members of the Obama administration – nyet. 

This is an administration that persecutes Catholic nuns, but appoints a cop killer’s attorney to a top DOJ civil rights position.

Philly.com reports that “in Adegbile’s corner, there are 75 organizations that have signed on to a letter to the United States Senate, urging the senators to confirm the nomination.”

Those organizations include everyone from the AFL-CIO to the National Center for Transgender Equality to the National Bar Association.
