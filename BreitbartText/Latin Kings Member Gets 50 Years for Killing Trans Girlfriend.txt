Latin Kings Member Gets 50 Years for Killing Trans Girlfriend

A Latin Kings member was planning on having sex with his girlfriend – until he discovered that she was born male.

Joshua Vallum, 29, was sentenced to 49 years in prison – a reduction from the original life sentence – for the murder of his girlfriend in Mississippi who he discovered was transgender, the New York Daily News reported.

During his plea, Vallum admitted to knowing that Williamson was transgendered during their relationship.

On the night of the murder, Vallum took Williamson across state lines from Alabama to Mississippi where he later tried to dispose of the evidence on property that his father owned.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions was satisfied with Vallum’s sentencing.

“Today’s sentencing reflects the importance of holding individuals accountable when they commit violent acts against transgender individuals,” Sessions said. “The Justice Department will continue its efforts to vindicate the rights of those individuals who are affected by bias motivated crimes.”
