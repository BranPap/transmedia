Activists Parade for Gay Rights in Vietnam

Some two hundred activists waving rainbow flags and carrying hand-painted banners biked in a colourful convoy through central Hanoi on Sunday as part of the communist country’s second gay pride parade.

Organised by Hanoi’s increasingly visible LGBT community, the event went ahead peacefully.

Vietnam normally tightly restricts demonstrations.

The country’s first ever gay pride parade was held a year ago.

Homosexuality remains largely taboo in Vietnam, with gay people routinely portrayed in the media as comical figures or as suffering from a condition that can be treated.

Gay rights have attracted high level support, with both the health and justice ministries coming out in support of lifting the ban on same-sex unions or even legalising gay marriage.

The law on marriage and family is due to be debated at the National Assembly later this year and any move to legalise gay unions would make Vietnam the first country in Asia to do so.

The move to lift the ban shows “a change in attitude of the state on the issue”, civil law official Duong Dang Hue told the Dan Tri online newspaper.

Public opinion on LGBTs in Vietnam is changing “really fast”, said Le Do Nga Linh, 29, a participant at the parade.

Experts have highlighted the fact that going easy on gay rights — which do not threaten the communist party’s control — may be a way for the authoritarian government to gloss over its otherwise poor rights record.
