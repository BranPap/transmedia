Texas School District Bans Trans Athletes from Girls’ Sports

A school district in Texas has enacted a ban on men participating in women’s sports as well as a ban on the use of preferred pronouns in the classroom.

“The district will not promote, require, or encourage the use of titles or pronoun identifiers for students, teachers or any other persons in any manner that is inconsistent with the biological sex of such person,” the new policy states.

Board member Casey Ford said the new policy reflects the wishes of the community.

“These policies are the product of input from several groups — the board’s policy committee, the district’s attorneys, the board’s attorneys, a committee of administrators and principals and, most importantly, community members,” Ford said. “But one group that’s had the most input and influence: the Texas state Legislature.”

Board member Becky St. John, who voted against the policy, disagreed, saying that the policy will “harm students in the classroom [and] overburden our teachers for a political agenda.”
