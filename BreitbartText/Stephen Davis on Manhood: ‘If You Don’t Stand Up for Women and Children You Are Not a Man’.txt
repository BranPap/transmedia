Stephen Davis on Manhood: ‘If You Don’t Stand Up for Women and Children You Are Not a Man’

Stephen Davis, known as conservative activist Maga Hulk, shared on Tuesday at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit in Tampa, Florida, the significance of manhood.

“Masculinity is not toxic,” Davis said. “Let’s make America masculine again.”

“Number one, and I believe this with all my heart, you have to be Godly,” Davis said, adding that faith in the Lord is essential to manhood.

 “If you don’t stand up for our women and children, you are not a man,” Davis said.

“Transgenderism is tearing apart the very fabric of reality and says that a woman is nothing more than a wig and some cosmetic surgery,” Davis said. “They’re tearing apart womanhood.”

“They’re coming after our children,” Davis said. “They’re absolutely doing an all-out assault when it comes to our children. That is absolutely disgusting and despicable and we are meant to be on the front line, we are the first line of defense.”

Fourth, Davis said, is strength, both physically and mentally, including being prepared to fight back against attacks from the left.

Fifth, Davis said, is discipline.

“This goes hand in hand when it comes to discipline,” David said. “You have to be disciplined, and you have to be robust, and you have to stand your ground. That’s what we do as men, we have the first and last line of defense.”

Davis declared that America is “the greatest country in the world.”
