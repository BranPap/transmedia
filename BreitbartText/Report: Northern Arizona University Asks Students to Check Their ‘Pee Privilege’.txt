Report: Northern Arizona University Asks Students to Check Their ‘Pee Privilege’

New signs placed outside restrooms at the Northern Arizona University are asking students to check their “pee privilege.”

The initiative is reportedly an effort to bring attention to transgender individuals who may feel unwelcome when entering a restroom. Various signs have reportedly been posted around the Northern Arizona University campus, according to Campus Reform, reminding students to be mindful of the needs and experiences of students of all gender identities.

“Do you have pee privilege?” one sign reads. The sign defines pee privilege as “never [having] to think about gender identity, ability, or access when peeing.”

“Do you have pee privilege?” Best part of the sign is that "ability" to pee constitutes privilege https://t.co/SQOvrLMQTD via @campusreform
