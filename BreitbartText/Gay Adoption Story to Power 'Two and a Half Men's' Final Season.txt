Gay Adoption Story to Power 'Two and a Half Men's' Final Season

Chuck Lorre’s veteran sitcom Two and a Half Men isn’t a button-pushing comedy in the All in the Family mold–even if Lorre himself often makes news with his Vanity Card pronouncements.

That may change during its final season on CBS, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

He wants to find a way to add more meaning to his life, so he decides he wants to adopt a child and in doing so, he starts the process and realizes that it’s very difficult to adopt a child as a single, straight man,” Tassler said. “So once and for all he decides, ‘I’m going to propose to Alan [Jon Cryer] and we’re going to get married and adopt a child as a gay couple.”

She called the story a “great ride,” and said that she views the storyline as a “very positive statement” about the wave of gay rights that are becoming more commonplace across the country and that she’s not worried about any sort of blowback from the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community….

The decision to explore gay adoption — and potentially marriage — comes a year after the series added Amber Tamblyn as a regular, playing Charlie’s long-lost lesbian daughter.

Something viewers won’t see during the show’s final episodes–a return from former star Charlie Sheen. Tassler ruled out a Sheen cameo.
