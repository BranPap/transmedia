Boston Children’s Hospital Claims Puberty Blockers ‘Completely Reversible’; Director Admits They Cause Infertility During Use

The Boston Children’s Hospital claims that puberty-blocking drugs are “completely reversible” although during use, they stop sperm and egg production, according to the director of their gender clinic in a video obtained by Breitbart News.

It goes on to claim that “These are temporary medicines that are completely reversible; they do not cause any permanent changes.”

Despite being the director of the clinic, Carswell was unable to answer an audience member when she was asked whether or not the administration of puberty-blocking drugs could result in an inability to orgasm.

Carswell has also claimed on camera that children might know that they are transgender “from the minute they were born, practically.” She also cited “playing with opposite gender toys” as a sign that a child should be considered transgender.

“Playing with the opposite gender toys” is a sign your child is transgender.

Carswell received $3,055 from Endo Pharmaceuticals in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available. Endo Pharmaceuticals manufactures Supprelin LA, which is used off-label as a puberty blocker.

An article co-written by Carswell titled “Pubertal suppression for transgender youth and risk of suicidal ideation” had to be corrected after it claimed the authors had no potentially conflicting interests. The article was corrected to note that Carswell “has received an advisory board stipend from Endo Pharmaceuticals.”

In a different article titled “Addressing Legislation That Restricts Access To Care For Transgender Youth,” the conflict of interest statement notes that “Dr. Carswell previously served as a consultant to Endo Pharmaceuticals in June 2018.”

This report is part of an ongoing investigation from Breitbart News exploring the links and incentives between pro-transgender activism, pharmaceutical companies, and other medical interests.
