‘I’m Sick of Being Bullied’: Female Skateboarder Bashes Red Bull for Having Her Compete Against a Trans Man

A female skateboarder has publicly bashed Red Bull for having her compete with a transgender man at the Red Stone Cornerstone event where she placed second.

“I am a female athlete. I have been skateboarding for eleven years and competing for several years,” she said in her Instagram post. ” I have been in three different contests with trans women, two of which I placed second. At the last contest series I did for Redbull, I placed second.

“I deserve to place first, be acknowledged for my win, and get paid. I reached out to Redbull and was ignored. I am sick of being bullied into silence,” she concluded.

Taylor Silverman also posted a screenshot of the email she sent to Red Bull’s Senior Sports Marketing Manager Erich Dumme, which she claims he ignored.

Taylor’s hit against Red Bull follows a lengthy op-ed from British cyclist Nicole Cooke arguing for transgender athletes to have their own category of competition separate from women’s sports.

“Sport is about competition among equals. Boxing has weight limits because there would be no contest putting a nine-stone man up against the largest man on the planet,” wrote Cooke. “Women’s sport is segregated because, in many disciplines, the larger average form of the male body confers an advantage.”
