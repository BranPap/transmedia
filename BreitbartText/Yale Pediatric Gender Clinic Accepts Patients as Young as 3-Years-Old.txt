She goes on to say that “We help them with their gender journey,” including “thinking through the benefits and the risks of medical intervention,” as well as “starting medical intervention.”

The director of the Boston Children’s Hospital, Jeremi Carswell, said in a video that “A child will often know that they are transgender from the moment that they have any ability to express themselves,” also remarking that “They knew from the minute they were born, practically.”

The Yale Pediatric Gender Clinic’s website explains that, following an evaluation, children are offered “a variety of medical treatments related to gender affirmation,” including getting put on puberty blocking drugs or hormone replacement therapy. Surgery is also available to those ages 18 and older.

The Food and Drug Administration recently warned that Lupron and Supprelin LA, two drugs that are commonly used off-label as puberty blockers, may result in brain swelling and even permanent vision loss.

Breitbart News previously revealed that the manufacturers of these puberty blockers, AbbVie and Endo Pharmaceuticals, have given money to various doctors involved with pediatric gender clinics, multiple medical associations that endorse the use of puberty blockers in gender dysphoric youth, and even an organization dedicated to securing high profile media appearances for children who consider themselves transgender.
