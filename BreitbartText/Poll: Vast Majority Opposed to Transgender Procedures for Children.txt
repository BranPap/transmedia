Poll: Vast Majority Opposed to Transgender Procedures for Children

Radical transgender activists appear to be in the minority as the vast majority of American voters are opposed to gender alteration procedures performed on minors, and most do not believe that “transgenderism” is healthy for anyone.

According to the survey, 64 percent of American voters who offered an opinion consider “transgenderism” an unhealthy condition.

However, an even stronger majority of those who offered an opinion on the issue, 90 percent, are against minors undergoing permanent gender alteration procedures.

The same percentage, 90 percent, also believe the medical professionals who perform these procedures should be fully transparent and “required by law to disclose the common, long-term medical and psychological impact of such procedures.”
