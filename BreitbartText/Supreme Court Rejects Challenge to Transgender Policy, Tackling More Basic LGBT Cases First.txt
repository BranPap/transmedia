Supreme Court Rejects Challenge to Transgender Policy, Tackling More Basic LGBT Cases First

WASHINGTON, DC – The Supreme Court declined Monday to take up a case claiming secular legal rights against transgender school policies, but will instead decide more basic LGBT legal issues next year.

Several students sued the school, claiming a constitutional right to refuse to be seen naked by members of the opposite sex. Lawyers also argued that the transgender policy violated Title IX in federal education law.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the district court, though on a different basis. The Third Circuit concluded that preventing discrimination against LGBT individuals and promoting acceptance of the LGBT agenda are such compelling public interests that any asserted constitutional right to the contrary must give way to advancing those interests.

The Supreme Court denied review of this case. However, conservatives should not construe that as a sign that a majority of the justices agree with the lower courts in upholding SOGI policies.

To the contrary, the Court recently granted review in the fall on two LGBT cases. One is Altitude Express v. Zarda, where the Court will decide whether, for Title VII’s federal prohibition on sex discrimination in employment, the term “sex” includes sexual orientation. In another case, R.G. & G.R. Funeral Home, the Court will decide whether “sex” includes gender identity.

But it is quite another for the Court to declare that there is a constitutional right to object to SOGI policies, aside from First Amendment rights of religious liberty and free speech. Before the justices would even contemplate such arguments, it is not surprising that they would first want to decide the much more basic issues raised in Zarda and in Funeral Home.

In fact, the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) is representing the non-LGBT parties in both the transgender case that the Supreme Court has already taken for next year, and the one the Court downed this week. So this issue is moving forward, while the justices are taking one step at a time on how to approach the matter.

Many parents and students nationwide strongly object to policies like Boyertown’s. However, elected school boards and elected state legislators can reject or reverse such policies at any time. Many conservatives draw a distinction between settling such matters through the democratic process versus inviting federal judges to decide these issues, with supporters on both sides of that argument.

The case is Boyertown Area School District v. Pennsylvania Youth Congress Foundation, No. 18-658 in the Supreme Court of the United States.
