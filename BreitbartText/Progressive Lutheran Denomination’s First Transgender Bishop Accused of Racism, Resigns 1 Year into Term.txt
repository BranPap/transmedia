Progressive Lutheran Denomination’s First Transgender Bishop Accused of Racism, Resigns 1 Year into Term

Lutheran Bishop Megan Rohrer of the Sierra Pacific Synod (ELCA), the first openly transgender bishop in a major Christian denomination, has resigned over racism allegations after firing the Puerto Rican pastor of a church in Stockton, California.

During college, Rohrer identified as a lesbian before becoming transgender and is married to a woman, Laurel.

Rohrer fired the Rev. Nelson Rabell-Gonzalez last December after an inquiry by the church into alleged verbal harassment and retaliation by the pastor, all of which he denied.

The removal of Rabell-Gonzalez upset members of the Misión Latina Luterana, who accused Rohrer of acting out of racist motives, and in March the Rev. Elizabeth A. Eaton, the denomination’s presiding bishop, appointed a three-person “listening panel” to investigate Rohrer’s actions.

On June 6, Eaton announced that a formal investigation into Rohrer’s conduct would be carried out based on “additional information that has come to light,” at which point Rohrer resigned as bishop.

On Sunday, Lutheran Church leaders began the process to discipline Rohrer following her resignation. “I shared that I am initiating the discipline process immediately including suspension of Bishop Rohrer, based on additional information that has come to light,” Eaton said.

“Let me state clearly,” Eaton wrote in a statement Wednesday. “The ELCA is a church that will not tolerate racism in any way. We will hold ourselves as fully accountable as any other person or group, and we will condemn racism wherever it exists.”
