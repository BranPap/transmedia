Washington State Mulling Addition of ‘Gender X’ Next to Male and Female on Birth Certificates

The state of Washington is mulling the idea of adding a third choice for a baby’s gender on state birth certificates to placate transgender activists, according to reports.

The department said it is considering the option for people who are “intersex, agender, amalgagender, androgynous, bigender, demigender, female-to-male, genderfluid, genderqueer, male-to-female, neutrois, nonbinary, pangender, third sex, transgender, transsexual, Two Spirit, and unspecified.”

The Evergreen State already has a process to allow adults to change their birth certificates to add designations other than male or female. The process, though, requires a medical provider testifying that the change was made under “appropriate clinical treatment” or a court order.

But the change would allow adults to simply request the change without providing medical testimony. Minors, though, would continue to be required to have medical testimony for the change to be made.

Gay activist groups praised the move saying it is ideal for normalizing claims by the LGBT community that there are more than two genders.

Jac Archer, the vice chair of the Spokane County Democrats and who labels himself “genderqueer,” agreed.

“It would be great to have my legal documents reflect what I know to be true about myself,” he said.

Despite their general approval of the proposal, gay advocates still complained that requiring minors to provide a doctor’s assessment for the change presents an “undue burden” on young people hoping to be recognized as “non binary.”
