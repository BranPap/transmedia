Students at Women's College Reject Transgender Student Govt Candidate for Being a 'White Male'

The complicated world of gender re-assignment and racism has bitten the politically correct campus at the all female Wellesley College, as a student born female but choosing to become a man has been denied a spot in student government for being a “white male.”

The problem is laid out by Ruth Padawer of The New York Times in a Wednesday piece that explores the plight of a Wellesley student who chose the name “Timothy” upon entering the college.

Timothy discovered that a Facebook campaign was launched calling on students to abstain from voting. If enough students refused to vote for Timothy–the only one on the ballot for the position–he would be disqualified for the position by failing to get the minimum number of students to vote for him.

So, why was this campaign started? Was Timothy not a girl, turned male, a duly recognized transgender person? Are the students against the transgendered?

The NYT found the answer to that question.

“It wasn’t about Timothy,” the student behind the Abstain campaign told the paper. “I thought he’d do a perfectly fine job, but it just felt inappropriate to have a white man there. It’s not just about that position either. Having men in elected leadership positions undermines the idea of this being a place where women are the leaders.”

So, despite the long-time claims of the women’s college that the transgendered are fully accepted, they really don’t want them in leadership because they identify as men. And, being white, Timothy had two strikes against him.
