Judge Rules Transgender Born a Girl Cannot Use Boys’ Restrooms

On Friday, a U.S. District judge in Norfolk, Virginia, refused to allow a 16-year-old who was born a girl but later deemed to have gender dysphoria to use the boys’ restrooms in the high school.

U.S. District Judge Robert Doumar rejected the preliminary injunction of Gavin Grimm, 16, against the Gloucester County School Board, prompting the American Civil Liberties Union to appeal the decision to a federal appeals court.

The principal had allowed Grimm to use the restrooms starting from roughly October 20, 2014 and continuing for approximately the next seven weeks, according to the lawsuit. Parents strenuously complained, leading to a board meeting on November 11,2014. The ACLU moaned that at the school board meeting some people referred to Grimm as a young lady.

At a later school board meeting on December 9, the school board voted 6-1 to limit access to the communal restroom based on “biological gender.” The board stipulated that students with “gender identity issues” use “alternative” restrooms. On December 10, Collins informed Grimm that the boys’ restrooms were off-limits.
