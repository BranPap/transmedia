Transgender Activists: Be More Sensitive to Bruce Jenner

Former Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner’s decision to transition from a man into a woman has been met with mixed reactions from the media and population at large. The pending change has also caused local and national transgender groups to call for people to be more sensitive towards Jenner’s perceived choice, and to denounce those who are turning what is largely viewed as Jenner’s journey into a punchline.

Studies suggest that transgender people are prone to depression and suicide at much higher rates in general, and also in higher numbers than the lesbian, gay, and bisexual adult population. A surveyed study conducted by the Williams Institute at UCLA’s school of law in January of 2014 showed that the prevalence of suicide attempts by transgender peoples was 41%, which vastly exceeds the 4.6% of the national average. Suicide attempts among trans men were at 46% and 42% for trans women.

Rachel told CBS Sacramento that what Jenner is going through is “personal” and that it’s something he, like other transgender individuals, must go through on his own. “It’s a serious thing, it’s not a joke. They’re not doing it for fun. They’re doing it to be their authentic self.”
