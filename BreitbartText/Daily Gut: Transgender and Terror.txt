Daily Gut: Transgender and Terror

So a dude at the UN named Martin Scheinin filed a report calling for a trashing of our current counter-terrorism policies. The new plan, he believes, should “abandon the ‘war paradigm'” and “enshrine the principles of gender-equality and non-discrimination…”

Okay.

I can’t figure out if this is the worst story ever, or THE GREATEST STORY EVER.

I mean, in terms of revealing what the UN does best, this report takes the transgendered cake: simultaneously undermining the war on terror while making a mockery of common sense. When the UN isn’t trying to minimize mass murder, this mishmash of maniacs is trying to commit it themselves.

But it should be no surprise that the UN would put the feelings of a cross dressing, transgendered person before the safety of millions of airline passengers. I would hope that the gay, lesbian and transgendered community would find this equally as ludicrous – and that such thinking risks the lives of everyone, including their own.

But if they don’t, I don’t care.

I’ll still be wearing my floral caftan in first class.

It has embroidered sunflowers.

And if you disagree with me, then you’re probably a racist.

Tonight we’ve got the delightful Alyson Camerata, the sharp-as-a-tack John Devore, Oderus Urangus (from Gwar, as if you need to know), and the hysterical Allen Covert!
