Gov. Ron DeSantis Signing Landmark Bill to Protect Women’s Sports

JACKSONVILLE, Florida — Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is signing a bill aimed to protect women’s sports — a move that comes at a time the left pushes to allow biological males who say they are female to compete against — and with — biological girls.

“In Florida, girls are going to play girls’ sports and boys are going to play boys’ sports,” DeSantis said Tuesday to applause.

As Breitbart News reported at the time, “The state House had earlier approved the bill, but it did not advance in the Florida Senate. Ultimately, the ban was made part of a popular charter school bill and was passed by a vote of 23-16 in the Senate, reported the News Service of Florida.”

“It’s not meant to be hurtful. It’s not meant to be discriminating. It’s not meant to attack any group,” Florida Sen. Kelli Stargel (R) said, defending the measure, explaining it comes down to fairness and the fundamental physical advantages and physiological differences that biological males have compared to females.“This is not about that. This is about sports and having competitive advantage and having the ability to compete,” she said, adding that the measure is meant to aid women, giving them the opportunity “to participate, to get scholarships, to excel with other women of like strength and capability.”
