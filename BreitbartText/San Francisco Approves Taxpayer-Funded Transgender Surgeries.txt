San Francisco Approves Taxpayer-Funded Transgender Surgeries



The San Francisco Health Commission on Tuesday approved of these controversial operations; public health officials in the city and transgender rights advocates discussed how they could get procedures such as mastectomies and genital reconstruction surgery covered under San Francisco’s universal health care system for individuals who consider themselves transgender.

These measures were approved even though San Francisco, under current Mayor Ed Lee, has had to slash local services and increase the local tax burden on residents to cover the city’s record $7 billion budget for the last fiscal year. 

“That’s why we applaud San Francisco’s decision to allow transgender people the ability to receive the medical care they need to be healthy,” Wertz proclaimed. 

Thomas Moyer, a San Francisco resident who authored “A Conservative Survival Guide To San Francisco,” said San Francisco taxpayers could not foot the bill for transgender surgeries.
