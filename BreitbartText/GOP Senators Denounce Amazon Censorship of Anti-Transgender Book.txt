GOP Senators Denounce Amazon Censorship of Anti-Transgender Book

Two prominent U.S. senators have criticized Amazon’s heavy-handedness in erasing a bestselling book by scholar Ryan Anderson on transgenderism.

“American oligarchs, cheered on by leftist politicians, are conducting digital book burnings,” Rubio tweeted Tuesday. “@Amazon banned a thoughtful & well researched book on a complicated issue.”

We reached out Amazon yesterday for an explanation

So far they feel no need to respond https://t.co/nqbIiS9hzx

“The corporate left begins the banning of books. Openly and without apology. Welcome to the new normal,” Hawley tweeted in response to a comment warning of the problem when one of the world’s biggest corporations begins “deciding what constitutes ‘appropriate’ thought & information.”

In his tweet, Rubio linked to a Wall Street Journal op-ed by the editorial board decrying Amazon’s arbitrary removal of Anderson’s book.

In the essay, titled “Tech Censorship Is Accelerating,” the WSJ editors noted Amazon had “purged” Anderson’s 2018 book, which “criticizes recent progressive ideas about gender and especially the wisdom of sex-change procedures in children.”

“Corporate media censorship, such as Amazon’s scrubbing of a heretical book, is accelerating,” the editors noted.

The book explores the biological, psychological, and philosophical backstory to the transgender debate.

It has received numerous positive reviews from doctors and professors of psychiatry, psychology, and medical ethics at universities such as Johns Hopkins, Boston University, New York University, and Columbia University.

As Breitbart News has noted, Amazon’s decision to de-list Anderson’s book came just days before a congressional vote on the Equality Act, a piece of legislation Anderson opposes.
