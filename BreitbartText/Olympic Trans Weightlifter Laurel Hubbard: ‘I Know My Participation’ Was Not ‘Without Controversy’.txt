Olympic Trans Weightlifter Laurel Hubbard: ‘I Know My Participation’ Was Not ‘Without Controversy’

New Zealand transgender Olympic weightlifter Laurel Hubbard thanked the Games and supporters but admitted that the competition sparked a lot of controversy after flaming out in Tokyo on Monday.

“Thank you so very much for your interest in my humble sporting performance tonight,” Hubbard told the media on Monday. “I know from a sporting perspective I did not live up to the standards I put upon myself.”

“I know my participation in these games has not been entirely without controversy,” Hubbard added.

“[The IOC has] been extraordinarily supportive, and I think that they have reaffirmed the principles of the Olympics that sport is something that all people around the world can do, that it is inclusive and successful,” Hubbard insisted.

Ahead of Hubbard’s doomed appearance, reporters were handed guidebooks on how they should speak about the transgender athlete’s participation that was prepared by a group of LGBT activist organizations with the approval of the International Weightlifting Federation.

The booklet ordered reporters to ignore “misinformation” that transgender athletes have an “unfair advantage” and told them to “familiarize yourselves with … anti-LGBTQ groups and their campaigns targeting transgender access to sports,” according to PA Media.

In the end, there wasn’t much reporting to guide as far as Hubbard is concerned.
