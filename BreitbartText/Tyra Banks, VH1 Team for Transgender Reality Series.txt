Tyra Banks, VH1 Team for Transgender Reality Series

Former model Tyra Banks is prepping the third VH1 series featuring transgender stars.

TransAmerica, an eight-episode docuseries, observes a group of transgender Chicago women and how their sexuality matters in their day to day lives.

Model/activist Carmen Carrera will lead the five women in the hourlong series slated to bow in late 2014 or early 2015. Banks (America’s Next Top Model) will executive produce alongside Gay Rosenthal (Behind the Music, Push Girls, Little People, Big World).

“It would be easy to focus on the transgender aspect, but this series is about so much more,” said Susan Levison, executive vp programming for VH1. “This is a show about a group of compelling, gorgeous young friends who are on a unique journey while staying true to their authentic selves. We believe that message resonates.

The channel has a history of shining the spotlight on the transgendered community.

The docuseries I Want to Work for Diddy helped jump-start the career ofOrange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox in 2008, with the actress earning a spinoff series — TRANSform Me — in 2010.
