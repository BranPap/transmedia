Bruce Jenner Breaks President Obama’s Twitter Record

Bruce Jenner did more than debut as a woman on Monday; the former Olympian and reality TV star also broke President Obama’s Twitter record.

Jenner joined Twitter shortly after her cover for the June issue of Vanity Fair hit the Internet, and amassed more than 1 million Twitter followers in just four hours. Obama, who previously held the record for fastest to 1 million followers, had accomplished the feat in five.

Jenner’s second tweet (the first was just a posting of the VF cover) had garnered roughly 225,000 retweets and more than 310,000 favorites at the time of this post. Variety reports that the news has generated more than 1.5 million tweets.

I'm so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can't wait for you to get to know her/me.
