U.S. Trans Athlete: ‘My Goal Is to Win the Olympics So I Can Burn a U.S. Flag on the Podium’

A transgender BMX freestyle rider and U.S. Olympic team alternate once said that his goal was to win the Olympics so he could burn the American flag on the podium.

In comments obtained exclusively by Fox News, Chelsea Wolfe made it clear that his goal was to win and burn the flag as a way of exacting retribution against the Trump Administration for hurting “trans children.”

However, Wolfe told Fox News that the since-deleted post should not be construed as hatred towards America.

“Anyone who thinks that I don’t care about the United States is sorely mistaken,” Wolfe told Fox News. “One of the reasons why I work so hard to represent the United States in international competition is to show the world that this country has morals and values, that it’s not all of the bad things that we’re known for. I take a stand against fascism because I care about this country, and I’m not going to let it fall into the hands of fascists after so many people have fought and sacrificed to prevent fascism from taking hold abroad. As a citizen who wants to be proud of my home country, I’m sure as hell not going to let it take hold here.”

Wolfe, a biological male, is Team USA’s first trans athlete.
