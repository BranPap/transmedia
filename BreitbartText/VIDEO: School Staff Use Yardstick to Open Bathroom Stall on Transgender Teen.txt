VIDEO: School Staff Use Yardstick to Open Bathroom Stall on Transgender Teen

A 17-year-old boy living as a transgender female claimed he caught on video the moment several school administrators forced open the door to his bathroom stall while he was still inside, but school administrators say the video does not tell the whole story.



“I’m using the bathroom right now and they just violated me,” the student says in the video.

A second video showed school officials ordering the student to leave school property while he points out several school administrators who “violated” him.

“This is the dude that violated me,” he said while naming the school administrators.

“I am aware of social media posts that significantly misrepresent an incident that occurred at school on Nov. 28. It’s important for you to know that no students were barred or banned from using any bathroom at Osseo Senior High,” Principal Michael Lehan said in a statement.

Lehan added that school administrators only enter a restroom stall when there are concerns for students’ safety or health, or if there is suspected illegal activity taking place.

“I sincerely wish I could say more, but for data privacy reasons, I cannot provide details about a situation involving a specific student,” he said.
