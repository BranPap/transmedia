Trump Jr. on Champion Transgender Cyclist: ‘You Can Never Be Woke Enough!’

The sports world reacted on Monday to news that transgender cyclist Rachel McKinnon, a biological male, had smashed even more women’s cycling records.

You can never be woke enough! Sorry to all female athletes who spent their lives mastering their games. 

Transgender Cyclist Who Set Women's World Record Wouldn't Have Qualified For Men's Championship https://t.co/r6YMS5IYkG

“Dr. Rachel McKinnon, who was born a man, also won the 2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling World Championships in Los Angeles in 2018, among other events.”

However, unlike in many previous incidents, the naturally born female competitors who were defeated by McKinnon did not remain silent.

“It was an unfair race, and I accepted that when I pinned on the number, and I tried to do my best to overcome the unfairness,” racer Wagner-Assali said of McKinnon’s dominance over natural-born female racers.

McKinnon, however, denies that he is dominating the women’s sport.

“I haven’t won any Olympic medals. I haven’t won any elite world championships.”
