Transgender Movies Take the Spotlight at Venice Film Festival: ‘A Child Who Feels She Is a Boy’

This year’s Venice Film Festival in Italy, which kicks off Wednesday,  features two movies in the official competition that have transgender protagonists — including a 12-year-old girl who believes she is a boy.

L’immensità stars Penelope Cruz as the mother of a 12-year-old girl, Adriana, who believes she is a boy and wants to changer her name and her sex. Directed by Emanuele Crialese, the Italian-language movie takes place during the 70s and follows other members of the immediate family on their tumultuous emotional journeys.

“The perception she has of herself is that she is a girl who is born biologically as a child who feels that she is a boy,” Crialese told Variety.

“It’s like there is this misperception around her [in the way she is perceived by others] and the mystery of it is: What is this misperception that she feels? Is it a mental problem? Is it something that will pass? A fleeting thing? The fact is that, more than the other two children, she embodies distress.”

A Variety article claimed that the director is also transgender but it remains unclear if that it is true.

The English-language Monica stars American transgender actor Trace Lysette as a trans “woman” who returns home to care for her ailing mother (Patricia Clarkson). Lysette previously appeared in the Amazon Studios series Transparent, also playing a transgender person.
