Boston Children’s Hospital: Children Know They Are Trans ‘the Minute They Were Born’

A harrowing video from the Boston Children’s Hospital claims that children can know that they are transgender “from the minute they were born, practically.”

“Playing with the opposite gender toys” is a sign your child is transgender.

In the video, Carswell makes the startling claim that “A child will often know that they are transgender from the moment that they have any ability to express themselves.” She continues and doubles down, remarking, “They knew from the minute they were born, practically.”

Breitbart News previously revealed that Carswell has received thousands of dollars in compensation for consulting on behalf of Endo Pharmaceuticals, a company that makes a drug that is used off-label as a puberty blocker for children who are considered to be transgender. 

An academic paper, authored in part by Carswell, had to be corrected after it was incorrectly asserted that the researchers had no conflict of interest.

Carswell’s consultation regarded the drug Supprelin LA, which is used as a puberty blocker. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently warned that Supprelin LA can cause swelling of the brain and loss of vision.

In the video, Carswell cites a number of different behaviors that supposedly provide evidence that a child is transgender and may be suitable to undergo permanent, life-altering surgery or medical intervention, including playing with “opposite gender toys,” refusing to get a haircut, or trying on a sibling’s clothing. 

Breitbart News previously reported that the Boston Children’s Hospital advertised “gender-affirming” hysterectomies for adolescents in a video. 

Breitbart News previously uncovered that children’s hospitals throughout America, particularly those that offer sex change operations and other medical interventions to gender dysphoric minors, had sponsored their local pride parades.
