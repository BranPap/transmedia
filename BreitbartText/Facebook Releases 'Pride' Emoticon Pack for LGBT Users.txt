Facebook Releases 'Pride' Emoticon Pack for LGBT Users

Facebook is adding to its LGBT resumé with a new “Pride” pack that allows users to color their chat messages with rainbows, “same-sex cuddles,” and 28 different emoticons. The “Pride” pack has a caption reading, “Love is universal.”

Facebook’s announcement coincides neatly with Barack Obama’s pronouncement of June as the official Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month.

A “Facebook Diversity spokesman” exulted, “We’re celebrating Pride by adding these free Facebook Messenger stickers to the Sticker Store. We see this as one more way we can make Facebook a place where people can express their authentic identity. Happy Pride!”

Facebook has been trumpeting its LGBT pride for some time; months ago, it allowed users custom gender options with 50 choices, including trans female, androgynous, and intersex. In May, Facebook apologized for erasing a picture that showed two lesbians kissing.
