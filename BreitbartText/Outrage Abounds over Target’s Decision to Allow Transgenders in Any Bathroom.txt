Outrage Abounds over Target’s Decision to Allow Transgenders in Any Bathroom

People have taken to social media to express disgust and outrage over Target’s decision to allow transgender people to use any bathroom or fitting room.

Is a boycott of Target more appropriately called transgender-cott? Regardless, I'm joining in.

It's as if Target is insisting that women and girls be victims inside its stores.  https://t.co/QaAhSDaA4f

So today we learn that @Target is unsafe for women, and @ESPN won't tolerate opinions that aren't left wing. I'll be avoiding both now.

So @Target has decided to allow men in dresses to go into the restrooms with our daughters, denies women guns for self defense. 

Awesome.

@Target has lost my business. Forever. #target

It pains me to say this because my daughter loves the place. 

Me and my family will no longer shop at @Target 

That is all.

The safety of my family outweighs any feel good about yourself policy. @Target

@YoungCons Obviously @Target doesn't give a crap about my children's safety in their stores. Will be cancelling my credit card.

“Corporate America must stop bullying people who disagree with the radical left agenda to remake society into their progressive image,” stated AFA President Tim Wildmon.

Warner Todd Huston highlighted 25 stories that prove Target’s new policy is dangerous to women and children.

@Brad_D80 @NYlegendd @FoxNews It's disgusting were going to have to wait for kids to get molested before people (hopefully) see reason.

“I don’t care what they think,” explained Sandy Rios, AFA’s director of Government Affairs and host of Sandy Rios in the Morning on AFR Talk. She added:

Personally, this is common sense. And we have to do something. Let me also add, AFA’s position on this is that there are family restrooms. And if there aren’t, there should be one gender neutral bathroom. Nobody wants a transgendered man not to have a place to go to the bathroom. That’s not the point. … Our position is, let’s have a family bathroom, or something that’s neutral.
