Trump: ‘I Don’t Know Yet’ What’s the Right Thing For States To Do on Transgender Bathrooms

On Wednesday’s broadcast of ABC’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live, “presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said that he doesn’t know yet what states should do regarding which bathroom transgendered people should use.

After Trump said he believes the decision on which bathroom transgendered people should use should be a state issue, he was asked how he would vote if New York was deciding. He answered, “Well, the party generally believes that whatever you’re born, that’s the bathroom you use.”

After being asked again what he personally supports, Trump repeated that he wants the states to decide, and they’ll “hopefully” do “the right thing.”

When asked what the right thing is, Trump answered, “I don’t know yet.”
