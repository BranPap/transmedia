Richard Dawkins Tells Those Wanting Universities To Be Safe Spaces To ‘Leave, Go Home, Hug Your Teddy And Suck Your Thumb’

Richard Dawkins has told university students who cannot handle anti-transgender views to “leave, go home, hug your teddy and suck your thumb.”

Some activists studying at Cardiff University do not approve of Germaine Greer’s views on transgendered women. As such they campaigned to deny one of the major voices of the second-wave feminist movement a platform on which to address their fellow students, as Breitbart London previously reported.

Some responded angrily, with one subscriber tweeting that “people who expect to be paid to spout transphobic nonsense have no place at a university”. Professor Dawkins had no time for that idea.

.@indented  Those who think it's nonsense are entitled to stay away. Or come and argue. They should not censor views they think are nonsense

Finally Professor Dawkins could contain himself no longer. Driven to deride Dr. Greer’s critics by their preference for ‘safe places’ over genuine academic inquiry, he made clear he had no time for such infantile reactions.

A university is not a "safe space". If you need a safe space, leave, go home, hug your teddy & suck your thumb until ready for university.

It seems that Dr. Greer may have the last laugh. Contrary to earlier reports, this afternoon Cardiff University told The New Statemsan that is has spoken with her representatives and the event is going ahead as scheduled in November.
