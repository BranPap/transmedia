Top School Headmistress Demands: Kids Should Be Raised ‘Gender Neutral’

The headmistress of an exclusive girls’ school in England has urged that children are raised in a “gender neutral” way, going so far as to suggest that boys could have “girlie makeup” and girls could wear “fireman’s outfit[s]”.

Jo Heywood, who is headmistress at the Heathfield boarding school in Ascot, made the comments to the Sunday Times, insisting: “Girls and boys should be allowed to explore roles traditionally associated with the opposite sex.”

But Ms. Heywood is adamant: “If a little boy wants to explore wearing a princess dress and a little girl wants to spend time in a fireman’s outfit, then that is to be encouraged . . . Have girlie make-up, but let boys have it too.”

The school’s alumni includes Princess Alexandra, Sienna Miller, CEO of Jimmy Choo Tamara Mellon and a host of other famous, public figures.

Professor Alan Smithers, an expert on education at Buckingham University commented: “Putting three-year-olds into clothes for the opposite sex is silly and they will be teased by other children”.

“This kind of parenting will not advance the cause of equality. Instead of opening up a wider range of opportunities, it will actually result in some very unhappy and disoriented children.”
