“There is so much more work to do and I know we are committed and we understand the importance of this movement and our roles of leadership in this ongoing movement,” Harris added. “So happy Pride, everyone.”

During Harris’s time at the downtown Pride parade, one unidentified individual asked her when she would visit the border, a question she has faced numerous times over the last few months but has not fully answered.

Harris, who has been tasked to oversee the crisis at the southern border by President Joe Biden, has yet to make a trip to the U.S.-Mexico border, telling NBC’s Lester Holt, who pressed her on the issue, that she will visit “at some point.”

“At some point, you know, we are going to the border,” Harris told Holt. “We’ve been to the border. So this whole … thing about the border. We’ve been to the border. We’ve been to the border.”

“You haven’t been to the border,” Holt responded.

“And I haven’t been to Europe,” Harris said as she laughed. “And I mean, I don’t understand the point that you’re making. I’m not discounting the importance of the border.”
