U.N.: Transgender Individuals No Longer Mentally Ill

The U.N. health agency known as the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that individuals who claim to be transgender no longer have a mental illness.



“The decision was not only based on the advocacy or feedback from the concerned communities,” she continued. “All available evidence was reviewed and discussed by an external advisory group and together with the scientific basis of this condition and the feedback from the professional community and concerned communities formed the basis of this decision.”

Say referenced a similar decision “on removing homosexuality out of ICD completely.”

“This again was based on the scientific understanding that there was no clear evidence that this issue needs to be medicalized,” she said.

“The intention is to reduce barriers to care,” he said.

The WHO states the version of ICD-11 that will be presented to the World Health Assembly in 2019 will go into effect officially on January 1, 2022.

“While there will be a few early adopters, not many countries are likely to adapt that quickly,” the WHO states, adding that the United States only switched to ICD-10 – which was released in 1990 – in 2015.

Other changes to mental health disorders in ICD-11 include a new gaming disorder, a hoarding disorder, and reclassification of “excessive sexual drive” as “compulsive sexual behaviour disorder.”
