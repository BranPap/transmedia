Trump says transgender hopeful can enter pageant

(AP) Trump says transgender hopeful can enter pageantBy ROBERT JABLONAssociated PressLOS ANGELESDonald Trump wished a transgender woman who wants to be Miss Universe good luck on Tuesday as his organization said she can vie for Canada’s spot in the pageant.

The statement said Trump wished Talackova “the best of luck in her quest for the crown” as he would any other contestant.

Earlier Tuesday, Talackova and her attorney Gloria Allred urged the organization to clarify its position, and displayed a copy of Talackova’s passport, which lists her as female, as do her birth certificate and driver’s license.

Talackova, a Vancouver resident, underwent a sex change four years ago after being born a male.

Her sex change initially led organizers in Canada to disqualify her from the 61st Miss Universe Canada pageant in May, citing a rule that she must be “naturally born” a woman.

Talackova and Allred urged Trump to state that she can vie to represent Canada in the Miss Universe contest if she wins the Canadian contest. They also called on him to eliminate the rule.

In response, the pageant organizers issued a statement saying “Gloria Allred’s statements to the press today pay no mind to the fact that Mr. Trump and the Miss Universe Organization made the fair and just decision in allowing Jenna to compete in the Miss Universe 2012 Canada pageant.”

It also said it’s evaluating its rules to ensure that type of issue does not occur again.

The rule requiring a contestant to be “naturally born female” appears to still be in effect in other countries around the world, Allred said.
