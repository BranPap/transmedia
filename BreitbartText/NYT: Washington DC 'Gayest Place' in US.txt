NYT: Washington DC 'Gayest Place' in US

An article in the Sunday Styles section of the New York Times, asks if Washington DC is the ‘gayest place’ in America?

Today, having moved here 10 months ago after six and a half years of living in Manhattan, I hardly recognize that closeted, often intolerant Washington I first glimpsed as a 20-year-old. I now live in the gayest place in America.

Citing Gallup and Census data, Jeremy Peters explains that DC has the “highest percentage [10%] of adults who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.”  The Census Bureau reports that DC has highest percentage [4%] of same-sex couple households.
