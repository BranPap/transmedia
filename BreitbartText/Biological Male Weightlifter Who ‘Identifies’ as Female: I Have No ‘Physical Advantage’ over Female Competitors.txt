Biological Male Weightlifter Who ‘Identifies’ as Female: I Have No ‘Physical Advantage’ over Female Competitors

A New Zealand weightlifter, who is a biological male who identifies as a female, claims that he does not have a “physical advantage” over his female competitors.

Laurel Hubbard, who made his “transition” to female four years ago, claims that there is no “fundamental difference” between himself and his female competitors, and that those who say otherwise are being “disrespectful.”

“I don’t believe there is any fundamental difference between me and the other athletes, and to suggest there is, is slightly demeaning to them,” Hubbard added.

Hubbard crushed his rivals at the Australian International weightlifting competition in Melbourne back in March, when he made four new records.

Despite his critics’ objections, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) allowed him to compete in the Commonwealth Games, a worldwide sporting competition that serves as a qualifying round for athletes headed toward the Olympics.
