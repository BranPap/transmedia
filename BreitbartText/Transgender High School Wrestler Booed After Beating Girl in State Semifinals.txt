Transgender High School Wrestler Booed After Beating Girl in State Semifinals

A transgender high school wrestler was booed, after he beat a female competitor to advance to the state championships on Saturday.

Beggs drew criticism last year for joining the female wrestling team when his parents claimed he was beginning the “transition” from female to male, using a testosterone regimen therapy. Opponents sued the school claiming that the testosterone gave the student an unfair advantage against his female opponents.

Beggs was able to continue wrestling with girls despite the testosterone treatments in part because in 2016 the state’s governing body, the University Interscholastic League (UIL), had ruled that students had to compete in the gender class that appears on their birth certificates.

The UIL also noted that the student’s testosterone treatment doesn’t fall under banned substances because a doctor prescribed the drug.

Last year, Beggs’ parents claimed that their “son” was an “inspiration” to others.

Still, other parents at the school say that despite everyone’s support for Beggs’ “transitioning,” he shouldn’t be allowed to compete in a contest of strength among other girls.

After the teen won his bout, Saturday, some boos were heard in the gallery:
