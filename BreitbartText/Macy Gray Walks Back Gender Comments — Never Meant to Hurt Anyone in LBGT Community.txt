Macy Gray Walks Back Gender Comments — Never Meant to Hurt Anyone in LBGT Community

Macy Gray said Thursday on NBC’s “Today” that her comments on gender were not meant to hurt anyone in the LGBT community while addressing the backlash.

Co-host Hoda Kotb said, “You were on the Piers Morgan show, and there was a question about trans women. This is what you said in part, ‘As a woman, just because you go change your parts doesn’t make you a woman. If you want me to call you a her, I will, because that’s what you want, but that doesn’t make you a woman just because I call you a her just because you got a surgery. You can call yourself whatever you want.’ There was a wave of backlash that came as a result. Just tell many where you are right now on that statement.”

Kotb said, “I think life is an education process. The more you sit with people, talk with people, it changes your perspective. Has your perspective changed, do you feel?”

Gray said, “I’ve learned so much, and I think you know, being a woman is a vibe, and it’s something I’m proud of, and it’s very precious to me. I think that if you in your heart feel that that’s what you are, then that’s what you are, regardless of what anybody says or thinks. You know what I’m saying? So, but, yeah, I’ve learned a lot, absolutely. And I’m glad I did because now I know.”
