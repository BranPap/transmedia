Ratings Plummet for Second Episode of ‘I Am Cait’ Jenner Reality Show

Ratings for the new reality TV series about Bruce Jenner’s life as a transgender woman have plummeted in the show’s second week.

The sophomore episode of E!’s I Am Cait drew just 1.292 million viewers, down roughly half from the 2.732 million who tuned in to the show’s premiere per live plus same-day viewers, reports ratings tracker TV By the Numbers.

As the Hollywood Reporter points out, the 1.3 million viewers for Jenner’s show is lower than any episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians the network has aired in terms of live plus same-day viewership.

Perhaps it’s Jenner’s conservatism that is driving viewers away.
