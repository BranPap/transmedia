Sarah Silverman: Trans Troops ‘More’ Heroic Than Rest of Military

Actress Sarah Silverman declared Tuesday that transgender military members are actually “more” heroic than others serving their nation.

1) Are you fucking kidding me?! 2) what other horrible thing is this news a decoy for at the expense of our heroes – our trans military are heroes like the rest — more so —because they have to deal with this shit from people whose lives & way of life they are protecting. https://t.co/RxlJV3LvCM

Silverman has a history of unhinged and angry social media postings. During the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh, she openly wished for the president to be “violated.”

“I hope you someday understand what it is to be held down against your will and violated. Your compassion is startless,” the 48-year-old said in a social media post after Trump said that anti-Kavanaugh protesters were being paid by George Soros.

Today’s SCOTUS decision permitting the Trump administration to continue its ban on trans servicemembers while the litigation is pending is a travesty of justice and a blow to the heart of all notions of equality and fairness.
