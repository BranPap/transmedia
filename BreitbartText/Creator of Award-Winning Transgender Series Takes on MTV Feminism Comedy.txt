Creator of Award-Winning Transgender Series Takes on MTV Feminism Comedy

Jill Soloway, creator of Amazon’s transgender series Transparent, is reportedly teaming up with MTV for a comedy series about modern feminism.

The still untitled project will reportedly follow two young girls who meet at summer camp and bond over their shared passion for “second-wave feminism,” according to the Hollywood Reporter.

“Lyle and Ashley have a magical ability to tap into the female psyche, and through their own special brand of truth and humor they absolve us of our most humiliating moments,” Soloway told THR of working with the pair. “I’m so excited to godmother this show and bring Lyle and Ashley’s fresh take on lady power to MTV.”

MTV’s senior vice president Mina Lefevre spoke of the collaboration with Soloway:

We are thrilled to be in business with the incredibly talented Jill Solloway. When she and Brillstein Entertainment introduced us to Lyle and Ashley and shared with us this fresh and funny take on a female comedy — we knew we had to be in business with this dream team.

Soloway’s latest project, Transparent, an Amazon original drama about a family struggling with the father’s admission that he is transgender, won this year’s Golden Globe award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy.

The show’s star, Jeffrey Tambor, also won a Globe for Best Actor in a comedy series. He dedicated that award to the transgender community.
