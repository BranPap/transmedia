Union Boss Randi Weingarten: Parental Rights Bills Are the ‘Way in Which Wars Start’

Randi Weingarten, union boss of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), said that parental rights bills such as the one recently signed into law in Florida are “the way in which wars start.”

Florida and other states have passed laws that give parents greater access to school curriculums and information regarding their children as well as more streamlined avenues to request information from schools.

In what appears to be an attempt at saving face for having an anti-parent position, Weingarten told Fox News, “Educators welcome parent involvement in schools because our kids do best when teachers, parents and caregivers work together.”

She then went on to call the parents’ movement that has found electoral success across the country “vocal minorities,” attempting to delegitimize parental concern with school curriculums and policies.

It is unclear to which books she is referring, but the most prominent books conservatives seek to remove from schools are Lawn Boy by Jonathan Evison and Gender Queer: A Memoir by Maia Kobabe, which prominently feature depictions of pornography and pedophilia.
