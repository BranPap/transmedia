“I feel overwhelming gratitude for the incredible people who have supported me along this journey,” she wrote. “I can’t being to express how remarkable it feels to finally love who I am enough to pursue my authentic self.”

Page added: “I love that I am trans. And I love that I am queer. And the more I hold myself close and fully embrace who I am, the more I dream, the more my heart grows and the more I thrive.”
