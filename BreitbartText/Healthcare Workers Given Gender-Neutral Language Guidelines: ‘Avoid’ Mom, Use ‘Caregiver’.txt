Healthcare Workers Given Gender-Neutral Language Guidelines: ‘Avoid’ Mom, Use ‘Caregiver’

Healthcare workers at UnityPoint Health in Iowa were given new guidance urging them to “avoid” gendered words such as “mom” and “dad,” urging them to replace them with non-gendered words and phrases instead.

“At UnityPoint Health, we aim to create a culture of belonging for the people and communities we serve,” Macinzie McFarland, a senior marketing communications specialist for UnityPoint Health – Des Moines told Breitbart News, describing the guidance as optional.

This is just one of several recent examples of gender-neutral language permeating today’s culture. The online dating site Match.com, for instance, provides over two dozen gender options for individuals signing up — from“polygender” to “neutrois.”

Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky has been known to use the term “pregnant persons” to describe a pregnant women, and the publicly-funded British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) recently came under fire for using the phrase “pregnant people” in its coverage of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.
