‘Survivor’ Contestant Fired from Job after Outing Fellow Player as Transgender on TV

Survivor contestant Jeff Varner has been fired from his real-life job as a real estate agent after outing a fellow contestant as transgender during an episode of the hit reality TV show this month.

“I was devastated,” Varner told ET. “[I warned the company that headlines might be coming], but apparently not the people who needed to hear it.”

During the tribal council portion of the April 12 episode, Varner turned desperate as it became apparent he would be voted off the island.

Then he turned to fellow contestant Zeke Smith and suddenly asked: “Why haven’t you told anyone that you’re transgender?”



Varner was voted off the island anyway (for the first time ever, no official vote was taken; Probst just informally confirmed with the other contestants) and the moment caused a firestorm on social media, with the show’s fans berating him for outing a transgender man against his will.

The three-time contestant quickly issued a statement apologizing to Smith and fans for “recklessly” revealing something he “mistakenly believed everyone already knew.”
