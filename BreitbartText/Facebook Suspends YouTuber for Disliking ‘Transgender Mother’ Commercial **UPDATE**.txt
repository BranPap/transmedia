Facebook Suspends YouTuber for Disliking ‘Transgender Mother’ Commercial **UPDATE**

Popular conservative YouTuber Mark Dice has allegedly been suspended from Facebook after insulting a Baby Dove soap commercial that featured a transgender “mother.”

“The Dove soap company has a new commercial out titled ‘No One Right Way’ which features a transgender ‘woman’ as a new ‘mom’ holder ‘her’ little baby,” wrote Dice in the status, which has since been removed by Facebook. “Excuse me now while I go grab some Irish Spring to clean up my puke.”

The post was reportedly removed by Facebook for violating their “community standards,” before Dice was also allegedly suspended from the platform.

Numerous conservative and anti-SJW personalities have previously been suspended from Facebook, including Twinks4Trump creator Lucian Wintrich, Gab founder Andrew Torba, transgender YouTuber Blaire White, prominent Islam-critic Pamela Geller, and political commentator Robbie Travers.

Breitbart Tech has reached out to Facebook for comment.

**UPDATE**

A Facebook spokesperson responded to Breitbart Tech’s inquiry, saying: “We’re very sorry about this mistake. The post was removed in error, so we have restored it.”
