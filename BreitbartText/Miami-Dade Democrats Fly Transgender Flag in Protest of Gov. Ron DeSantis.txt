Miami-Dade Democrats Fly Transgender Flag in Protest of Gov. Ron DeSantis

Democrat protesters in Florida’s Miami-Dade County flew a transgender flag as well as a sign calling for the end of capitalism in protest of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) over the weekend — a move that comes as Florida Republicans continue to overtake Democrats in terms of voter registration in the Sunshine State.

One photo shows a variety of flags and signs at the protest. The transgender flag can be seen prominently, along with a large sign reading, “Down with Nazis, capitalists, commies of empire.” Florida Research also reported a red flag with hammer and sickle, along with a black anarchist flag. Other signs included “My body, My Choice” and “Keep Abortion Legal”:

They also carried banners with communist slogans such as "Down With Capitalism".
