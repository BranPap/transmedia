Transgender Comic Moved from Men's Facility to Women's Prison

MILTON, Ontario,  Feb. 12 (UPI)–Avery Edison, a transgender woman held in a men’s jail for visa concerns, was moved to a women’s facility after an online protest, a Canadian official said.

The general duties manager at the men’s Maplehurst Correctional Facility confirmed Edison, 25, was in good health and transferred to the Vanier Center for Women in Milton, Ontario, Tuesday, Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported.

Edison and her partner, who had been working to get Edison transferred, said authorities recognized the possibility of violence existed at the men’s facility, CBC said. Edison’s partner said the comic was separated from the general population at Maplehurst, where she spent the night.

Friends, family and others began a Twitter campaign to demand that Edison be transferred to a woman’s facility, the CBC said.

“Just spoke with Avery and confirmed she has been moved,” RahRah posted Tuesday night.

“[Great] thanks to the friendly Internet strangers who have been re-tweeting this horrible situation into a thing the media cares about,” read another tweet.

“Finally, thanks to all journalists who have been covering this honestly and respectfully — we’re overwhelmed with gratitude,” another post read.
