“I’m hopeful of a future where everyone is welcomed for just being themselves — everywhere,” Sikes continued in his post. “If you are going through a hard time today, remember that life is too short to ponder on the things lost.”

“Choose happiness & always look for the positive things throughout life. Move on. See the good. See the bad. Hope for the best. Brave the worst,” the student added.

Sikes is not the first male student identifying as female to be rejected from Greek Life.

In 2017, a student named Adam Davies was reportedly rejected from all 12 sororities at Northwestern University.
