Obama: Transgender Kids ‘Vulnerable’ and ‘Subject to Bullying’

President Barack Obama defended his decision to release a rule forcing schools to allow students to use their bathroom of choice regardless of gender.

“We’re talking about kids,” Obama said, pointing out that lesbian, gay, and transgender children were “subject to a lot of bullying” in school.

He insisted that public school administrators had approached the Department of Education for guidance on the subject, which was why they issued a ruling.

The transgender issues, he warned, would not go away, pointing out that the courts would be responsible for setting the tone for the future.

He said the rules was the result of his “best judgement” on the issue, although he declined to go into specifics on the Justice Department’s decision to sue the State of North Carolina over their recent bathroom decision.
