British Nursery Age Toddlers Given Picture Books Encouraging Transgender Questioning of Gender

Young children are being read books that calls on them to re-assess their gender identity, thanks to an educational charity that works as part of a movement encouraging “queering the education system”.

In another book, Are You a Boy or Are You a Girl?, the main character queries their gender identity. Questions for children to engage with after reading the book include: “Does it matter if Tiny is a boy or a girl?”, and “Should Tiny be allowed to play football and dress up as a fairy?”.

Breitbart London has reported on the activities of Educate and Celebrate in the past. In July 2016 the group moved to praise new government guidelines which told schools to address transgender children using the pronoun “zie” to avoid falling foul of the Equalities Act.

“If you’re new to the ‘trans’ community, this is very new language.”

In 2015, the group bought a large number of copies of new children’s book, Prince Henry, to distribute to schools. The book tells the story of a gay prince in a royal family who defies convention and his father’s wishes to marry his manservant, rather than a princess.
