NCAA Could Pull Tournaments if Oklahoma Passes Transgender Bill

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is threatening to pull events from states trying to protect female athletes from transgender competition, including Oklahoma.

Lawmakers in Oklahoma are debating the Save Women’s Sports Act. On Monday, the NCAA threatened states who are considering similar measures with losing lucrative tournament contracts. That means Oklahoma’s contract to host the Women’s College World Series until 2035 could be in jeopardy.

As Breitbart News reported, the NCAA Board of Governors made the announcement as legislatures in more than two dozen states propose, debate, and advance legislation aimed at requiring state schools to ensure that athletes compete in the category of their assigned birth gender.
