Transsexual Conservative Wanna-Be MP Proud Advocate of Bondage



Hewitt describes herself as an “advocate of the BDSM (bondage, discipline and sadomasochism) community”, she also says she is into swinging and “pet play”, which is dressing up as an animal for sexual purposes.

This is not the first time Hewitt has courted controversy, her defection from the Labour Party raised eyebrows to start with, and her continued involvement in the trade union movement has led many activist to question her views. 

Hewitt has been the subject of attacks throughout her political career. In one video uploaded to YouTube, a man mocks her for being a transsexual. She has also been compared to Nikki Sinclaire, a transsexual Member of the European Parliament who used parliamentary privilege to suggest that Nigel Farage had an affair with one of his staff.

On her Facebook page she describes herself as a “Conservative- Blue Blarite. Pragmatic progressive liberal”. She says she cares about the world and want to make a difference.
