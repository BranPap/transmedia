Boosie Badazz Claims Planet Fitness Banned Him for Rant About Dwyane Wade’s Child

A Georgia Planet Fitness has given the boot to rapper Boosie Badazz after he recorded a video about the transgender child of basketball star Dwyane Wade inside the gym.

Boosie Badazz — whose real name is Torrence Hatch Jr. — aired his grievances in a rambling Instagram post Thursday in which he said he was kicked out of a Planet Fitness club near Atlanta.

Boosie added in a written note that a “manager who was gay refused to let me in Planet Fitness because of my past actions on social media about gender etc.” He also accused the location of having cockroaches and poor water heaters, dubbing the business “#roachfitness.”

A spokesperson for Planet Fitness said in a statement to People magazine that Boosie was harassing gym staff.

“Planet Fitness does not tolerate harassment or discrimination of any kind. In this instance, a guest was asked to leave after refusing to comply with gym policies and harassing club staff,” the statement reads.

Basketball player Dwayne Wade announced earlier this month that his 12-year-old child who was born a boy is now a transgender girl named Zaya. Boosie criticized Wade’s announcement in an earlier Instagram post in which he said the basketball star had gone “too far.”

“I gotta say something about this shit, bro. Dwyane Wade, you gone too fucking far, dawg,” the rapper said in the post. “That is a male. A 12-year-old. At 12, they don’t even know what they next meal goin’ be. They don’t have shit figured out yet. He might meet a woman, anything, at 16 and fall in love with her. But his dick be gone — how he gon’ — like, bruh, you going too far, dawg.”
