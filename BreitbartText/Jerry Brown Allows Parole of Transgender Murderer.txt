Jerry Brown Allows Parole of Transgender Murderer

Gov. Jerry Brown will not interfere with a Board of Parole Hearings’ recommendation that a transgender inmate be paroled and lose the chance to force the state to pay for sex-change surgery.

Judge Jon Tigar ruled in April that the state should provide the surgery for Jeffrey Bryan Norsworthy, who now goes by Michelle-Lael Norsworth. According to Joyce Hayhoe, spokeswoman for California Corrections Health Care Services, the surgery would cost the state up to $100,000.

Norsworthy, 51, shot Franklin Gordon Liefer Jr. to death 30 years ago. Norsworthy was 21 and Liefer 26 when they argued in a Fullerton bar, precipitating the fatal shooting. Liefer died six weeks later; Norsworthy was convicted of second-degree murder.

Norsworthy started taking female hormones in 1999; in 2012 Norsworth queried the corrections department about funding the sex-change surgery.

Quine is in prison for life for committing murder, kidnapping and robbery.
