Alabama Ban on Gender Transition Surgery, Drugs for Children Takes Effect

An Alabama law making it a felony to conduct gender transition surgeries or provide puberty blockers and other hormone treatments to children under the age of 19 took effect Monday, carrying a sentence of up to ten years in prison for those convicted.

“Our state is prepared to defend our values,” Ivey continued. “Like I said, we need to focus on properly developing our children into the adults God intended them to be.”

The groups that filed the lawsuit, including GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders and Human Rights Campaign, say the law will do “immediate and irreparable” harm to the plaintiffs, who include four “transgender youth,” two doctors, and a minister. President Joe Biden’s Department of Justice led by Attorney General Merrick Garland has also joined the case against the Alabama law.

Alabama is the first state to successfully implement such a measure, as the Arkansas legislature attempted a similar protection only to meet the veto of the Natural State’s governor Asa Hutchinson (R).

Relatedly, Ivey signed another child protection bill banning the discussion of sexual orientation in K-5 classrooms as well as requiring children use the restroom that aligns with their biological sex.

The White House published a transgender fact sheet stocked with “resources” to honor “Transgender Day of Visibility” from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

As Breitbart News reported, “The most heinous option involves transforming children’s bodies via irreversible surgeries with the goal of ‘aligning their outward physical traits with their gender identity.'”

In other words, the Biden administration is promoting cutting off young girls’ breasts and fashioning fake penises out of the tissue of another body part.
