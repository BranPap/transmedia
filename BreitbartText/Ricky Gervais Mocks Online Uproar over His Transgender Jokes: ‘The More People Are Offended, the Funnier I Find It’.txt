Ricky Gervais Mocks Online Uproar over His Transgender Jokes: ‘The More People Are Offended, the Funnier I Find It’

Actor-Comedian Ricky Gervais is once again taking heat from transgender activists after he made a joke about the recent J.K. Rowling controversy in which the Harry Potter author was blasted for voicing support for biological sex over transgender ideology.

Gervais posted a sarcastic tweet Friday in response to the SJW-parody account Jarvis Dupont, which mocked the negative criticisms of Rowling.

“Those awful biological women can never understand what it must be like for you becoming a lovely lady so late in life,” Gervais jokingly responded. “They take their girly privileges for granted. Winning at female sports and having their own toilets. Well, enough is enough.”

This isn’t the first time that Gervais as run afoul of transgender activists.

In October, Gervais responded to criticism that he mocked Canadian transgender woman Jessica Yaniv, who had earlier sued a group of beauticians for refusing to perform a Brazilian wax on Yaniv’s male genitalia.

“I don’t try to offend, but the more people are offended by a joke, particularly on twitter, the funnier I find it,” he tweeted. “And the angrier the tweet, the more chance of me using it and turning it to laughs and cash. PC culture isn’t killing comedy. It’s driving it. As it always did.”

Gervais’ most recent comments concerning the Rowling controversy have ignited an avalanche of negative social media feedback, with some people accusing Gervais of transphobia.

The comedian defended himself, saying the tweet was meant as a joke. He later got serious, saying that activists are trying “to create their own blasphemy laws” in order to silence their ideological opponents and even get them fired.

They don't want to argue. They can't afford to have their propositions questioned. They want to create a dogma with its own blasphemy laws and the "fatwah" of labelling people bigots to shut them down, ostracise them and even have them fired.

The Hollywood media have joined the social media pile-on by linking Gervais’ comments to his upcoming gig hosting the Golden Globes in what appears to be an effort to get him booted off the show.

“Gervais’ selection as Golden Globes host prompted some raised eyebrows when it was announced considering his history of controversial joke material, particularly jokes at the expense of trans individuals,” Variety noted.
