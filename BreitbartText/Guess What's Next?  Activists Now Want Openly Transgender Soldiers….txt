Guess What's Next?  Activists Now Want Openly Transgender Soldiers…

It didn’t end with securing the end of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.   Activists have their next social experiment for our US military already in sight: allowing   openly “transgender” troops in the US armed forces.




There is even a new activist organization that hopes to make it happen: the Transgender American Veterans Association.   I generally don’t buy “slippery slope” arguments.   But having declared that homosexuals have a “right” to serve openly,   how can we possibly stop those with gender issues from doing so?   The reality is,   we can’t.

And where exactly will these soldiers shower?   We will leave that question to the bureaucrats in Washington.
