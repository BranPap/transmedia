Not Woke Enough: ‘Handmaid’s Tale’ Novelist Margaret Atwood Blasted for Sharing Article Questioning Transgender Agenda

Author Margaret Atwood is a hero of the woke left, which has long adored her novel The Handmaid’s Tale and the feminist Hulu series adapted from it. But with one tweet, the novelist has now become the target of hate from the same woke fane base after she shared an article that questioned the increasing prevalence of terms like “person with a vagina” and “person who menstruates” in place of “woman.”

Why can’t we say ‘woman’ anymore? https://t.co/ghcQDJgxWE via @torontostar

For the act of simply tweeting the article, Atwood has received vicious social media blowback from her fans, some of whom compared her to Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, who has also voiced skepticism of the trans agenda.

Oh look you're angry language is finally starting to include people like me.  

Disappointed in you.  

But not shocked.

I hear JKR is looking for friends.  You can sit at her table.

Since Margaret Atwood is questioning why we can’t say “woman” anymore, I’ll reshare the essay I wrote last year after another famous white feminist author mocked inclusive language.https://t.co/f8iIimiAEv

Atwood is now facing accusations of being a “TERF” — a pejorative term invented by trans activists that stands for “trans-exclusionary radical feminist.” The novelist also has defended the Toronto Star columnist against accusations that she is a TERF.
