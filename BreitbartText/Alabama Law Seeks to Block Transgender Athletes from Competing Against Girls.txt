Alabama Law Seeks to Block Transgender Athletes from Competing Against Girls

An Alabama state representative is sponsoring a bill to require transgender students to compete in school sports under their birth gender.

“Gender is real,” Rep. Pringle said in a press release. “There are biological differences between boys and girls that influence athletic performance. The GIRL Bill seeks to support female student-athletes so that they may compete against each other and not have to compete against male students with an unfair advantage.”

The bill also prevents any government-owned or operated sports facility from allowing biological boys from competing as girls.

The bill would, though, allow transgender players in co-ed sports.

Rep. Pringle’s bill echoes similar bills being introduced in other states.

Like the bill in Alabama, the Georgia bill would bar transgender youth from competing under their assumed gender at any publicly supported sports facility.

In another case, a Tennessee lawmaker recently filed a similar bill, as did a Republican lawmaker in Washington State.

Similar bills affecting transgenders are proliferating across the country. A bill was introduced in Massachusetts that would bar mental health counselors from aiding kids to become transgender.
