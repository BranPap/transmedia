LGBT Students at UCLA ‘Crying’ over Signs Held Up by Three Republican Club Members

Messages written on signs held up by three female members of UCLA’s student Republican club brought some of the school’s LGBT students to tears.

“It’s been from students crying to students feeling like they’re not safe on campus with people sharing these types of perspectives and negating their existence,” Bhattar said, according to abc13.

Bhattar says his group is planning a counter campaign that will include hanging posters around campus, with the message, “Bathrooms are a RIGHT not a privilege.”

The president-elect of Bruin Republicans, Alex Rhim, supports his members’ right to exercise free speech.

“They’re just expressing what they believe and that’s something that we support,” Rhim said.

“We’ve received personal attacks to even board members who were not involved in the incident, and we’ve actually had a bit of a controversy in our club because of this difference in opinion,” one member said.

In a statement responding to the controversy, UCLA’s dean of students, Maria Blandizzi, said, “At UCLA, we respect everyone’s right to free speech and encourage open dialogue on all issues.”

“However, hurtful language that seeks to belittle or trivialize any group is not reflective of UCLA’s values and our ongoing work to be a welcoming and fully inclusive environment for all,” Blandizzi’s statement concluded.

“We want to show love, we want to start with love and not with hate,” Bhattar said.
