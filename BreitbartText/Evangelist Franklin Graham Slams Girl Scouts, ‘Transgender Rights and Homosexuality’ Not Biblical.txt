Evangelist Franklin Graham Slams Girl Scouts, ‘Transgender Rights and Homosexuality’ Not Biblical

The celebrated evangelist Franklin Graham has said he won’t be buying any Girl Scout cookies this year, since the organization has lost its moral compass and is promoting licentious behavior.

The Girl Scouts organization sure isn’t what it used to be! https://t.co/yYFKoxS88Q

Graham wrote that Archbishop Carlson “told church members and scout leaders that the Girl Scouts is wrong in their support of transgender rights and homosexuality and is not aligned with the teachings of his church.”

He also said that “a Girl Scout troop in Utah was formed specifically to reach out to transgendered youth and that the Girl Scouts celebrated the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage on its Instagram and Twitter accounts.”

Archbishop Carlson is exactly right—the “ways of the world” are incompatible with biblical values. https://t.co/yYFKoxS88Q 1/2

Rev. Graham wrote that more church leaders “need his boldness in speaking the truths that set those who follow God’s Word apart from the rest of the world.”

“I don’t know about you,” Graham concluded, “but I won’t be buying any Girl Scout cookies this year.”
