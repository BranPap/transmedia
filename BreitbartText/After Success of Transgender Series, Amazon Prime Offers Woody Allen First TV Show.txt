After Success of Transgender Series, Amazon Prime Offers Woody Allen First TV Show

Director Woody Allen has been given the keys to write and direct his first television series, which will be available next year on Amazon’s Prime Instant Video service.

Amazon announced its decision to give Allen the reigns to his own project, just days after its transgender series Transparent took home multiple awards at Sunday night’s Golden Globes.

Allen also spoke of the opportunity, adding: “I don’t know how I got into this. I have no ideas and I’m not sure where to begin. My guess is that Roy Price will regret this.”

Sunday’s Golden Globes saw Amazon’s Transparent – an original series about a family struggling with its father’s admission that he is transgender – win this year’s Golden Globe award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy. The show’s leading man, Jeffrey Tambor, eventually took home the award for Best Actor in a Comedy Series.

Allen certainly won’t be the first member of his family to take on the task of trying to find television success. His estranged son, Ronan Farrow, from his marriage to Mia Farrow, has been hosting a daily program on MSNBC since Feb. of 2014.

The show, aptly named Ronan Farrow Daily, is again fighting rumors of a cancellation, after underperforming in ratings. The program now only averages around 50,000 viewers in the key 25-54 demographic.

At one point last year, Ronan Farrow Daily was reportedly outperformed by an 8 a.m. re-run of Golden Girls on the Hallmark channel.
