National Park Service Seeking Ways to Honor Historical LGBT Achievements



The “theme study” will be partially funded by the Gill Foundation, an LGBT advocacy group. Tim Gill and Scott Miller of Denver, Colorado, were among Barack Obama’s top bundlers for his 2012 presidential campaign.



Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Ambassador to Australia John Berry, who is openly gay, and several historians and scholars will “discuss ways to celebrate and interpret lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender history in the context of broader American history.”

Jewell announced the new initiative at the end of May at New York’s Stonewall Inn, named a national historic landmark for being the site of a 1969 riot said by gay activists to be the start of the LGBT civil rights movement.

Similarly, National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis added, “As we prepare to celebrate the National Park Service’s Centennial in 2016, we have rededicated ourselves to sharing more diverse stories of our nation’s history, particularly the struggles for civil rights.”
