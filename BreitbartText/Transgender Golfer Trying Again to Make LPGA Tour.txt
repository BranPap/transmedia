Transgender Golfer Trying Again to Make LPGA Tour

A transgender golfer is again trying to qualify for the women’s LPGA tour. 

Bobbi Lancaster is 63 years of age and played amateur golf when she was a man named Robert Lancaster. He then had “gender-reassignment surgery to become Bobbi Lancaster in 2010

Lancaster says she believes she is now “mentally tough” to handle the pressure after failing “to advance to the second stage of an LPGA qualifying tournament” in August after she “performed well enough to qualify for the LPGA’s developmental Symetra Tour in 2014.”
