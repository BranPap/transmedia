UPenn Swimming Parents Call on NCAA to Prevent Trans Competitors from ‘Trampling All over Biological Women’

Parents of female swimmers on the University of Pennsylvania swim team are calling on the NCAA to reform the rules regarding transgender competition to prevent biological females from being “bumped out” of competition.

“It starts with the NCAA,” said the parents of one UPenn swimmer. “I think the NCAA needs to change its policies and find a way to include transgender women without trampling all over biological women.”

“Penn hosted Dartmouth College and Yale University at a swim meet Saturday,” Fox News reported. “Thomas, a senior, won the 200-yard freestyle (1:48.73), the 500-yard freestyle (4:57.20), and finished fifth in the 100-yard freestyle (52.84).”

Thomas didn’t just dominate – for the most part – this past weekend. But the senior from Texas also broke two national records at a meet last month.

Despite his dominance in the water, the Ivy League and its member schools have voiced nothing but support for Thomas and given little or no mention of the female swimmers he’s dominated.

The Ivy League affirmed its “unwavering commitment” to providing an “inclusive environment” for Thomas.

“Over the past several years, Lia and the University of Pennsylvania worked with the NCAA to follow all of the appropriate protocols in order to comply with the NCAA policy on transgender athlete participation and compete on the Penn women’s swimming and diving team. The Ivy League has adopted and applies the same NCAA policy,” the conference said in a Thursday statement.

“The league welcomes her participation in the sport of women’s swimming and diving and looks forward to celebrating the success of all of our student-athletes throughout the season,” the statement concluded.

The University of Pennsylvania gave a similar statement of support.

The parents of another Penn swimmer talked about how their daughter, who competes in the same events as Thomas, had been directly impacted by the trans swimmer.

“When she came on to the team, she had dreams of maybe breaking some records, things like that and that may not be possible now,” the parents said. “And she’s angry that she sees her friends being bumped from relays or a roster that travels to a meet.”

The NCAA has not said whether they intend to change any of the rules regarding transgender competition.
