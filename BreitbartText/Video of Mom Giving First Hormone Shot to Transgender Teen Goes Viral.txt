Video of Mom Giving First Hormone Shot to Transgender Teen Goes Viral

The video of a mother giving her young teenager the first doses of hormones needed to continue a transgender transformation has gone viral.

The mother went on to note that the teen “had no idea on a timeline of when it would actually happen.”

“Sorry, I had to stop recording because we were both blubbering, sobbing fools,” the mother wrote.



The video was picked up by Buzzfeed and soon went viral, gaining over 2 million views in only three days.

The mom told BuzzFeed that the incident was “the most pivotal turning point in [the child’s] life, and we both knew it.” She also said that if there is any negative backlash, it would be worth it to help even one child.

A 2010 study by an official at the Census Department concluded that one in every 3,300 Americans has changed their name to a name associated with the other sex.
