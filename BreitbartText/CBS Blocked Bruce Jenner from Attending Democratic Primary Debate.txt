CBS Blocked Bruce Jenner from Attending Democratic Primary Debate

Self-described transgender conservative Bruce Jenner was denied entry into Saturday’s Democratic primary debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, despite having requested a ticket directly from CBS News.

The Los Angeles Times reports Jenner, who identifies as a Republican, was in town visiting the university campus with his reality show producers and expressed interest in attending the debate.

“Our person told her person that we don’t have any tickets left, which happens to be true,” Rhodes said.

Jenner instead watched the debate on TV with Drake University students on campus.

“They didn’t convince me,” Bruce told the Times of the Democrats.

The former Olympian was the Drake University relays champion in 1976.
