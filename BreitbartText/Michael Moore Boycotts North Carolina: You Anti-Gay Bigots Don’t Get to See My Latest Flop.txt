Michael Moore Boycotts North Carolina: You Anti-Gay Bigots Don’t Get to See My Latest Flop

Michael Moore joined rocker Bruce Springsteen and other celebrities in boycotting North Carolina after the state passed a religious freedom law that some have slammed as discriminatory against transgendered persons.

I have asked my distributor NOT to book my film in any theater in North Carolina due 2 their bigoted law against LGBTQ ppl. They have agreed

Gov. Pat McCrory signed the bill into law shortly after it passed the state legislature, but figures in the entertainment industry along with several businesses have vowed to boycott the state as a result of the legislation.

Bruce Springsteen canceled a planned concert in Greensboro in protest against the law, writing on his website that the “fight against prejudice and bigotry” is “more important than a rock show.” Filmmaker Rob Reiner also announced that he would no longer shoot projects in the state.

Rocker Bryan Adams followed suit this week, canceling a planned concert in Mississippi over that state’s passage of its own religious liberty law.

@MMFlint please boycott TN as well. Thanks

Where to Invade Next opened to mixed reviews in February and drew the worst opening-weekend box office of Moore’s nearly three decade-long career.
