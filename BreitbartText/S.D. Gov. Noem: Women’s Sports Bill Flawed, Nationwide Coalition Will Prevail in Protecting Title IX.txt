S.D. Gov. Noem: Women’s Sports Bill Flawed, Nationwide Coalition Will Prevail in Protecting Title IX

Republican South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem said at a press conference on Monday that she did not sign a bill passed in the state legislature because it was flawed and announced she is launching a nationwide coalition of stakeholders to push for preserving Title IX’s protection for female athletes.

“Today we’re announcing that we’re forming a coalition – Defend Title IX Now dot com,” Noem said.

She said the coalition will include state leaders, athletes at all levels, and “everyone who cares about women’s sports.”

Some members of the coalition were at the press conference, in person or virtually, including Herschel Walker, former American football player, bobsledder, sprinter, and mixed martial artist.

Jack Brewer, former American football safety who played professionally in the National Football League for the Minnesota Vikings, New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, and the Arizona Cardinals, also spoke via video at the press conference.

Former LPGA champion Nancy Lopez is also on board and Noem said at least two governors — Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma and Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi — have signed on and more are expected to join.

High school athletes also expressed their support for the coalition and shared their dreams of going on to play — and win — in college.

Reporters at the conference tried to get Noem to say that her efforts were targeting transgender individuals, but she said the bill simply addresses protecting female athletes from unfair competition from biological men who have many physical advantages. 

“Put simply it is fundamentally unfair for men to compete in women’s sports and it’s a violation of Title IX,” Noem said.
