Indiana Senate Sends Transgender Athlete Bill to Governor

On Tuesday, the GOP-led Indiana Senate sent a bill to Governor Eric Holcomb that, if signed, would limit the state’s male-born students to participating only in sports that correspond to their biological sex.

Indeed, the bill only limits students who were born male but claim to be females from joining women’s teams. It does not contain any limitations on students born female but who claims to be a transgender man.

Gov. Holcomb has not made any statements about the senate’s current bill, but in the past has said he “adamantly” agrees that “boys should be playing boys sports and girls should be playing girls sports, and mixed sports should be just that.” Still, he has said he wants to see a final bill before commenting on specifics.

According to the state’s athletic association, only one transgender student has applied to join a school team.

A spokesperson for Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita also noted that the AG’s office is prepared to defend the law in court if Gov. Holcomb signs it into law. Spokesperson Corrine Youngs added that the bill protects “the amazing progress made for women” in sports.
