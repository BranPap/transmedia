Sweden: Leftist Govt Proposes Allowing 16-Year-Olds to Legally Change Gender

Sweden’s leftist government has proposed lowering the age limit for people legally changing gender from 18 to 16 as part of a new gender recognition law.

“There is a big difference in changing legal gender, where we make the assessment of being able to lower that age limit from 18 to 16 years. When, on the other hand, we talk about the medical sex, which is preceded by doing gender-correcting treatments and medical procedures, the age limits remain,” Hallengren suggested.

“This is an issue where it is the healthcare system that makes the assessment of which care or possibly treatment is the very best. Not politics,” Hallengren claimed.

While Sweden was one of the first European countries to see hospitals approve of hormone therapy for children, the Karolinska hospital announced a U-turn on the issue last year after reports of side effects on children that had undergone treatment.

Sweden is not the only European country to propose new legislation on legally changing gender: Spain’s leftist government has also pushed for a new transgender law that would allow anyone over the age of 16 to change their gender with the Spanish Civil Registry without needing medical treatments.

Under the Spanish proposal, a 16-year-0ld would simply need to request their gender be changed and then return in three months to confirm their decision. The individual would then have six months to decide if they wanted to reverse their decision.
