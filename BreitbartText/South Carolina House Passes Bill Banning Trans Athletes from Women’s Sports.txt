South Carolina House Passes Bill Banning Trans Athletes from Women’s Sports

The South Carolina state House passed a bill on Tuesday banning transgender athletes from women’s sports, putting it on a path to join several other states that have passed similar measures.

“It is true that your girls will have a level playing field,” she said. “They will get the chance to compete only against other biological females, as reflected on their birth certificate, because we want them to have a chance to be successful.”

In March, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) signed a bill that will require athletes to compete on school, college, and university sports teams corresponding to their biological sex, which was followed by Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) signing a similar bill into law.
