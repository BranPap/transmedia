Emmy Noms Honor Climate Change Doc, Obama, Transgender 'Orange Is the New Black' Star

Today’s Emmy nominations included the usual snubs and surprises, but one factor bled through several categories. It’s good to embrace a left-of-center cause.

Not only did the climate change docuseries Years of Living Dangerously from Showtime earn a nod, so did President Barack Obama for turning a comedy short into a propaganda tool with the help of Zach Galifianakis.

Coincidence? Tell that to Al Gore who won an Oscar for his power point presentation An Inconvenient Truth. Or the folks behind the HBO movie Game Change, a cartoonish assault on Sarah Palin which scored a gaggle of industry honors.

The entertainment industry strives to honor the best and brightest, and in many cases does just that. Other times, it’s clear that there’s a thumb or two on the scales of artistic justice.
