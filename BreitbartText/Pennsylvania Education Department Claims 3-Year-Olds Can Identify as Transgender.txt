Pennsylvania Education Department Claims 3-Year-Olds Can Identify as Transgender

The Pennsylvania Department of Education claims children as young as three  can identify as transgender and lists “ne, ve, ze/zie and xe” as viable pronouns.

The website for the department also advises teachers to ask students before assuming what a student’s preferred pronouns might be.

According to the website, which is intended to be a guide for teachers, “binary gender” is the “faulty concept that there are only two genders: male and female” and “gender expression/gender presentation” is “how we show our gender to the world through external choices (e.g. dress, behavior, hairstyle).”

The department also advocates for teachers to celebrate a “gender-neutral day” in which students are asked to pick “two to three ways they will reject gender stereotypes for the day.”

“This is part of a national effort in schools to ‘break the binary’ by confusing young children about biological sex and indoctrinating them into believing that gender is a spectrum,” Parents Defending Education Director of Outreach Erika Sanzi told Fox News in a statement. “The Department of Education should delete these ideology based resources from their website and anyone teaching gender fluidity to three year olds does not belong in a classroom.”
