Transgenders Chastise Bruce Jenner for Conservative Views

Bruce Jenner is taking heat from liberal transgender women for being too conservative in his political views.

“Don’t a lot of times they can make more not working with social programs than they actually can with an entry-level job,” said Jenner. “You don’t want people to get totally dependent on it. That’s when they get in trouble.”

Jenner is now being criticized by transgender activists, with one saying the reality TV star has spent too much of his life living “in the bubble” to understand the living conditions of the less fortunate.

“Caitlyn has every right to be just as conservative as she chooses,” said one woman. “But many transgender men and women need social programs to survive, and that’s nothing to be ashamed of.”

“If Cait is going to be a spokesperson for the community, this is something she’s going to have to understand,” she continued.

Bruce told Diane Sawyer back in April that he has “always been more on the conservative side” and that he “believes in the Constitution.”

Now, many are questioning if Jenner will buckle to the pressure to please his peers.

The next episode of I Am Cait airs Sunday at 8 pm on E!
