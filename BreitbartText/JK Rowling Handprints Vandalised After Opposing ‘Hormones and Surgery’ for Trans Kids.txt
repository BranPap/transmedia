JK Rowling Handprints Vandalised After Opposing ‘Hormones and Surgery’ for Trans Kids

Handprints on the streets of Edinburgh honouring Harry Potter author Joanne ‘JK’ Rowling have been vandalised following her comments against the “medicalisation” of trans kids.

Rowling’s handprints — and only Rowling’s handprints — had been smeared over with blood-red paint, with the multicoloured transgender flag planted beside it, the Telegraph reports.

“Many health professionals are concerned that young people struggling with their mental health are being shunted towards hormones and surgery when this may not be in their best interests,” she wrote in a lengthy Twitter thread.

“Many, myself included, believe we are watching a new kind of conversion therapy for young gay people, who are being set on a lifelong path of medicalisation that may result in the loss of their fertility and/or full sexual function,” she added.

“I did not know who else had signed that letter. I thought I was endorsing a well meaning, if vague, message against internet shaming,” pleaded author Jennifer Finney Boylan.

“The consequences are mine to bear. I am so sorry.”

I did not know who else had signed that letter.  I thought I was endorsing a well meaning, if vague, message against internet shaming.  I did know Chomsky, Steinem, and Atwood were in, and I thought, good company.  

The consequences are mine to bear. I am so sorry.
