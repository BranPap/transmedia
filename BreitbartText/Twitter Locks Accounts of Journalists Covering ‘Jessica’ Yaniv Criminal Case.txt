Twitter Locks Accounts of Journalists Covering ‘Jessica’ Yaniv Criminal Case

Twitter locked the accounts of two journalists in Canada Friday after they attempted to live-tweet the proceedings of transgender radical Jonathan “Jessica” Yaniv, who is on trial for illegal possession of a weapon.

When reached for comment, Twitter did not specify precisely what rules had been violated or how.

Levant also noted that Anna Slatz, a reporter for The Post Millennial, was also suspended for tweeting about Keean’s suspension. The Post Millennial and Rebel Media have both closely followed the Yaniv trial.

Twitter suspended our reporter @TheRealKeean five times for live-tweeting from the court where accused criminal Yaniv is on trial. Now @YesThatAnna is suspended for tweeting about Keean’s suspension. No “misgendering” or “deadnaming”, just pure political censorship. 👇 pic.twitter.com/DrhtUpPN8e

In a message to Breitbart News, Levant said that Slatz did not engage in “deadnaming” — the use of a transgender person’s birth name — or “misgendering” — referring to a transgender person by their biological gender.

“Yaniv’s legal name is still Jonathan; his own mother calls him ‘him,'” said Levant. “The court case uses the name ‘Jessica Jonathan Yaniv.’ But in any event, why was Anna suspended — she didn’t ‘misgender’ or ‘deadname.'”

Hang on, @TwitterSafety. Did Yaniv’s own mother say “HE did not touch you”? Is she committing the Twitter crime of misgendering? Will she be suspended like reporters @TheRealKeean and @YesThatAnna were? Can we quote the mom or is that illegal too? pic.twitter.com/QF1Sk20vG1

Yaniv has attracted increased controversy and attention over the past two years, including for attempting to sue Canadian beauty parlors for their refusal to offer testicle-waxing services. Yaniv lost these cases.

Note: an earlier version of this article implied that Post Millennial reporter Anna Slatz is a conservative, which she is not. The article has been updated to reflect this.
