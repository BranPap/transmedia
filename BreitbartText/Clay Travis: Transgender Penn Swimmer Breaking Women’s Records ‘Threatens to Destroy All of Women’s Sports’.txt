Clay Travis: Transgender Penn Swimmer Breaking Women’s Records ‘Threatens to Destroy All of Women’s Sports’

Outkick founder Clay Travis on Wednesday reacted to transgender University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, a biological male, breaking women’s records.

Travis warned that the NCAA allowing Thomas to compete against females “threatens to destroy all of women’s sports” because men are biologically “bigger, stronger and faster than women.”

“And the bigger issue here is it threatens to destroy all of women’s sports, alright?” he continued. “Men — this is not sexism, this is biology — are bigger, stronger and faster than women. That is why we separate men’s and women’s athletics. So, if you are going to allow highly trained and highly skilled men to decide to compete against women, the women are not going to win, and this is a monster issue that threatens to become major for many other sports as well.”

Travis wondered if the females losing out to Thomas would speak out against having to compete against a male but noted they might be hesitant due to fear of being labeled “transphobic” by the “online Twitter mob.”
