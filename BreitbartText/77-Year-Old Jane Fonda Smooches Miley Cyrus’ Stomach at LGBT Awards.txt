77-Year-Old Jane Fonda Smooches Miley Cyrus’ Stomach at LGBT Awards

Miley Cyrus was honored with the Vanguard Award at the LGBT Center’s 46th Anniversary Gala Vanguard Awards on Saturday night — but before the ceremony started, Cyrus got some love from fellow LGBT advocate and actress Jane Fonda.

“There are more than 1.6 million runaway or homeless young people in the U.S. each year with 40 percent of homeless youth identifying as LGBTQ,” Cyrus said during her acceptance speech, according to E!

The singer then added:

And in just Hollywood where we are all sitting, royally with all of our food in front of us and all of these fancy ass clothes…something didn’t’ really feel quite right about it when we’re in a city where there are more than 6,100 homeless people under the age of 24 on the streets on any given day and more than one in four of these people have experienced hate crimes due to their race, sexual orientation or their gender identity.

Earlier in the night, Cyrus helped musician Linda Perry auction off an autographed white grand piano by licking it. The piano was eventually auctioned for $50,000.

Fonda was also reportedly honored at the gala Saturday night.

“As I see it, trans women are the frontline warriors in the battle against patriarchy,” Fonda said. “Because you better believe that any person who gives up penis privilege voluntarily is going to be a threat to the patriarchy.”
