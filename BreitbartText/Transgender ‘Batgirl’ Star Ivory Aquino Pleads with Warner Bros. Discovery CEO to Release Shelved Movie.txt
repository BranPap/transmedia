Transgender ‘Batgirl’ Star Ivory Aquino Pleads with Warner Bros. Discovery CEO to Release Shelved Movie

Transgender Batgirl star Ivory Aquino has launched a last-ditch effort to save the $90 million superhero movie from the dustbin of history, urging Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav to release the title that the studio deemed “irredeemable” and has permanently shelved.
