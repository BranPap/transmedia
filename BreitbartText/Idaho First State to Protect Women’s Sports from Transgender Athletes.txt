Idaho First State to Protect Women’s Sports from Transgender Athletes

Idaho Gov. Brad Little (R) signed a bill into law Monday that made his state the first in the nation to protect women’s sports from transgender athletes.

At the same time, Little signed into law HB 509, which prohibits changes in gender on birth certificates.

“We condemn Governor Little’s actions and the actions of dozens of Idaho legislators who are so focused on pleasing their bigoted base instead of doing what is right,” said Mistie Tolman, Idaho director of Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest and Hawaii, in a statement.

Tolman added Little “discriminated against thousands of Idahoans” by preserving women’s sports for women and girls alone, and referred to Idaho as “one of the cruelest states in the country for LGBTQ people, especially transgender people.”

This is disappointing and heartbreaking for the trans folks and our allies in Idaho https://t.co/NslOiekpWG

Tonight, hours before #TransDayofVisibility, @GovernorLittle signed the anti-#transgender #HB500, an egregious violation of the rights of Idaho’s #transgender and gender non-conforming/nonbinary students.

Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign LGBTQ activist organization, tweeted Idaho’s new law is a “travesty of justice”:

As last night’s travesty of justice in Idaho shows, anti-equality forces are prioritizing discrimination — even amidst a global pandemic. We must — and we will — hold these leaders and those of their ilk accountable. https://t.co/RSLzqtNvUx

LGBTQ rights group Lambda Legal threatened to sue Little, as did the ACLU of Idaho, which said some “will not forget this decision or what it says about the governor’s priorities during a global pandemic.”

#BREAKING: @GovernorLittle just signed anti-trans birth certificate bill HB 509 & anti-trans high school/college sports bill HB 500. We sued to allow trans people in Idaho to change their birth certificates & won…TWO YEARS AGO.

We'll see him in court. https://t.co/ItF4ehW60O

“The ACLU will see the governor in court,” the left-wing group said.
