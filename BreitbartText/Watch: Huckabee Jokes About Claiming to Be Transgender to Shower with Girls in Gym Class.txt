Watch: Huckabee Jokes About Claiming to Be Transgender to Shower with Girls in Gym Class

In lieu of former Olympian Bruce Jenner’s sex change, a video has surfaced of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, joking at the 2015 National Religious Broadcasters Convention in February in Nashville, TN about pretending to be a transgender in order to shower with the girls in gym class.

“Now, I wish someone could have told me when I was in high school that I could have felt like a woman when it came time to take shower in P.E. I’m pretty sure I  would have found my feminine side and said, ‘Coach, I think I’d rather shower with the girls today.'”
