Joe Biden Applauds Transgenderism with Launch of New ‘X’ Gender Marker

President Joe Biden will publicly get behind Transgender Day of Visibility on Thursday by introducing a new universal gender marking.

New Transportation Security Administration scanners that are gender-neutral are also planned as part of the administration-wide embrace of transgenderism and LGBTQI+ issues and people.

It is a continuation of Biden’s efforts to rewrite the way government engages “gender identity.”

Visitors to the White House will soon also be able to select an “X” gender marker option in the White House Worker and Visitor Entry System, which is used to conduct screening background checks for visitors to the executive mansion.

“In the past year, hundreds of anti-transgender bills in States were proposed across America, most of them targeting transgender kids. The onslaught has continued this year. These bills are wrong.”

Biden also has a pre-recorded video message to transgender Americans he will release on Thursday.
