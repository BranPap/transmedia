Transgender Star Eligible for Male and Female Oscar Categories

Kelly Mantle, a transgender artist, is now the first person to be eligible for an Oscar in both male and female categories.

Mantle, born a male, plays a transgender prostitute in the Miguel Ali-directed comedy drama Confessions of a Womanizer.

The Academy repeatedly agreed and said the transgender performer is eligible for nomination in both categories.

Confessions, which also stars C. Thomas Howell, Gary Busey, and Andrew Lawrence, premiered in March 2014 at the Cinequest Film Festival and follows a compulsive womanizer who becomes best friends with a transgender prostitute. It has won several awards.

Mantle’s most high-profile role to date was as a contestant on the sixth season of RuPaul’s Drag Race.
