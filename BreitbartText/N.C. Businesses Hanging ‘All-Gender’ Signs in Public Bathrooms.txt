N.C. Businesses Hanging ‘All-Gender’ Signs in Public Bathrooms

A gay-rights group called Campaign for Southern Equality is reporting that over six dozen businesses have contacted them for an “all-gender” restroom sign in an attempt to skirt the controversy surrounding North Carolina’s new religious freedom law with its gender-specific bathroom provisions.

The group reports that up to 77 businesses in Asheville, N.C. have contacted them to supply the “all-gender” signs.

Regardless of the type of bathroom, whether multi-user or single occupant, the signs are a way to skirt the rules that bathrooms specified to a gender should only be used by a person biologically matching the gender the facility is designated for.

The group’s spokesperson, Ivy Hill, also noted that they are getting requests for the new signs from as far aways as Texas and California and they are endeavoring to fill all requests.
