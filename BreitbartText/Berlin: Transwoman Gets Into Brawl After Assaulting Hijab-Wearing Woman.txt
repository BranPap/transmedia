Berlin: Transwoman Gets Into Brawl After Assaulting Hijab-Wearing Woman

A video showing a transwoman attacking a woman wearing a hijab in Berlin has gone viral with claims that the attacker also comes from a migrant background.

The video shows the transwoman shouting in a language that is not German and attempting to rip off the hijab of a Muslim woman walking away from them.

According to German theologian David Berger, who runs the blog Philosophia Perennis, the transwoman is speaking Arabic in the video and likely comes from a Syrian, Lebanese, or Palestinian background.

Imad Karim, a German-Lebanese journalist and filmmaker, told Berger that he was aware of a video released last year that showed Syrians and Arabs assaulting a transwoman and claimed the attacker in the video could be the same person attacked several months prior.

According to a report released in 2018, Berlin has seen a rise in anti-LGBT attacks, with the majority of the perpetrators revealed to be young migration-background men.

In 2017, the city saw 324 violent incidents, with most taking place in the districts of Tempelhof-Schöneberg, Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, and Neukölln.

Attacks on other vulnerable minorities, such as the city’s Jewish community, have also greatly increased in the German capital in recent years.
