Obamacare Now Covers Gender Reassignment Surgeries

Transgender Americans seeking gender reassignment surgeries are finding relief through Obamacare, The Daily Beast reported on Monday. 

Federal laws banning health insurance discrimination against transgender people, combined with Obamacare’s ban on denying coverage for those with pre-existing conditions, have paved a path for transgender patients who wish to make the transition from one gender to another. 

What gets covered varies from Obamacare policy to policy. But Transgender Law Center program administrator Anand Kalra says, “The law and policy are on a transgender person’s side for the first time.” 

Nationally, Obamacare is more unpopular than ever. The latest Kaiser Health poll finds that an all-time low of just 37% of Americans now support President Barack Obama’s signature legislative achievement.
