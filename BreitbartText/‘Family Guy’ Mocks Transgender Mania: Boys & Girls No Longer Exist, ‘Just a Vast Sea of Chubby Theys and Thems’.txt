‘Family Guy’ Mocks Transgender Mania: Boys & Girls No Longer Exist, ‘Just a Vast Sea of Chubby Theys and Thems’

FOX’s Family Guy lampooned transgender mania on Sunday’s episode, titled “First Blood,” in which Stewie believes he’s experienced his first menstruation after he hurts himself on a slippery slide.

In the scene, Stewie experiences gender confusion following his injury, explaining to Brian that he woke up to a “red dawn” and is “bobbin’ with the red robin,” adding that “it’s like The Shining elevator down there.”

In a 2020 episode entitled “The First No L,” family patriarch Peter is seen setting up the family’s nativity scene in the front yard but using a gender-neutral display of the manger.

Quagmire’s father, who is now a transgender woman named Ida, has been the subject of numerous jokes on the show. “Things that were gross five years ago are heroic,” one character said in a 2019 episode.
