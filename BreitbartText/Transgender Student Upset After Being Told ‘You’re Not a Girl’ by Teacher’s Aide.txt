Transgender Student Upset After Being Told ‘You’re Not a Girl’ by Teacher’s Aide

A transgender student in Fort Worth, TX filed a complaint against a teacher’s aide after the aide allegedly told the student he is not a girl after he used the women’s restroom.

Ishy Valdez, 16, a junior at Castleberry High School, was at Tarrant County College for a class last Wednesday when the aide saw him exit the women’s restroom.

Despite being born a male, Valdez said he feels more comfortable in the women’s restroom.

“In the women’s bathroom, I do feel more comfortable,” he told Fox 4. “I never get a second look.”

The teacher’s aide reportedly has not been on the bus since the incident, but is still working at the school.
