“Hate-mongering against LGBT persons on the rise in Russia after recent law,” he wrote on Twitter. “Repulsive. Inhuman.”

The two women, linked to the Ukrainian feminist group Femen, waved a rainbow flag at the embassy’s grounds and carried a sign saying “homosexual propaganda on Russian ground.”

They were supported by two other activists outside the embassy, who shouted “Gay Rights are Human Rights.”

One of the activists, Jenny Wenhammar, said the group was protesting against a recently enacted Russian law which imposes hefty fines for holding gay pride rallies or providing information about the gay community to minors.

Later Thursday a group of 150 to 200 people gathered outside the embassy for a peaceful demonstration against the same law.

The activities coincide with Stockholm Pride festival, which is being held this week and which has put special focus on gay rights in Russia.

Earlier this week, Sweden’s Foreign Minister Carl Bildt also reacted to the deteriorating situation for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in Russia.
