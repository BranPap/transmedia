Dave Chappelle Defends Free Speech: ‘First Amendment Is First for a Reason’

Stand-up comedian Dave Chappelle took a stand for free speech on Sunday, defending the First Amendment as he accepted the prestigious Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, honoring achievements in the field of comedy.

“The First Amendment is first for a reason. The Second Amendment is just in case the first one doesn’t work out,” Chappelle said, according to multiple reports. “The country’s getting a little tight. It doesn’t feel like it’s ever felt in my lifetime.”

Chappelle has come under attack from the mainstream media and leftist on social media over his Netflix special Sticks and Stones, in which he calls out “cancel culture” and performs a series of jokes about transgender individuals and politically incorrect impersonations.

“We all want to live in a polite society, we just kind of have to work on the levels of coming to an agreement of what that actually looks like,” Chappelle said on the red carpet Sunday, according to The Hill.

“I, personally, am not afraid of other people’s freedom of expression. I don’t use it as a weapon. It just makes me feel better. And I’m sorry if I hurt anybody,” he said, before adding, “Yada, yada, ‘everything I’m supposed to say.'”

USA Today reported that Chappelle joked about smoking indoors.
