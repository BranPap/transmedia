Conservative Lord to Boris: Stand Up to ‘Militant Transgender Fascist Lobby’

David John Maclean, Baron Blencathra, has urged Boris Johnson to “stand up to the small, militant, transgender fascist lobby” and for “the rights of 32 million real women” in a House of Lords debate.

The 66-year-old life peer told the Upper House his “blunt message to the Government… is this: when will you stand up to the small, militant, transgender fascist lobby and say that the rights of 32 million real women and 800,000 wheelchair users are more important than the rights of tens of thousands who identify as transgender?”

“As every doctor and even first-year medical student knows, there are only two biological sexes, male and female, with a tiny number of people who are known as genuine hermaphrodites, male pseudo-hermaphrodites or female pseudo-hermaphrodites,” Blencathra insisted.

He added that while genuinely intersex persons “deserves respect and support”, sex is “biological and binary and is not a social construct.”

“I say ‘absurdity’ but it is more of an obscenity, because we have the reality, as seen in Answers to Parliamentary Questions tabled by me, of male rapist convicts suddenly telling the Prison Service that they are identifying as women and our useless, incompetent, politically correct Prison Service immediately transferring them to female prison wings where they have raped and sexually assaulted real women prisoners,” he claimed.

“What a wonderful sexual predators’ charter.”
