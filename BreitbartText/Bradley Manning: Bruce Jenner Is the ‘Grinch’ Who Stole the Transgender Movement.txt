Jenner’s wealth, in addition to his standing as a high-profile reality TV star, has fueled claims he is out-of-touch with the trans community, despite his being viewed by many as the face of the transgender movement.

In other Jenner news, Bruce and his son Burt were mistaken for a couple on a date earlier this week in Los Angeles by a photographer who used a series of gay slurs during a confrontation with the eldest Jenner son.

According to Gossip Cop, Burt, 37, and his dad had just finished dining together when they were confronted by a group of paparazzi on Monday Dec. 21.

As seen on a security video below, Bruce exited Burt’s car and drove away in a white SUV, while Burt blocked a photographer’s car from pursuing his father.

Watch the video, courtesy of TMZ:


“I’m straight, I’m straight, I’m not a faggot like you.” said the unidentified photographer, who was reportedly unaware he was speaking to Jenner’s son.

“You’re the first boyfriend of the f—king transexual, dude,” he said. “You like it in the f—king ass, don’t you?”

“I hate faggots like you,” said the man as he drove away.

Watch the video:



Burt wrote of the video, “I punked more paparazzi and this one wasn’t happy.”
