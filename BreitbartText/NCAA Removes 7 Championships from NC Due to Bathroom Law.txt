NCAA Removes 7 Championships from NC Due to Bathroom Law

The NCAA removed seven previously scheduled championship events from North Carolina for the upcoming academic year because of the state’s bathroom law.

“Based on the NCAA’s commitment to fairness and inclusion, the Association will relocate all seven previously awarded championship events from North Carolina during the 2016-17 academic year,” the collegiate athletics governing body explained in a release. “The NCAA Board of Governors made this decision because of the cumulative actions taken by the state concerning civil rights protections.”

The contests pulled from the state include Division 1 women’s soccer, golf, and lacrosse championships, and first- and second-round games in the men’s basketball tournament.

The NCAA also cited restrictions by New York, Minnesota, Washington, Vermont, and Connecticut on public employees traveling to the Tar Heel State, among other reasons, to justify the removal of the events.
