Texas Governor Announces Investigation of ‘Transgender’ Child Claims

Texas’s Child Protective Services agency will investigate the dispute over the claimed transgender status of a seven-year-old child, says Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.

The divorced mother says the boy — James Younger — wants to be a transgender girl named “Luna.” The father, however, says the boy is being pushed by his mother to dress like a girl.

FYI the matter of 7 year old James Younger is being looked into by the Texas Attorney General’s Office and the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services. #JamesYounger

In Texas, these childcare disputes are handled by the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, while the Attorney General provides legal advice and services to the agency.

AG Ken Paxton’s office has not released a statement via Twitter.

This is heartbreaking and sets a horrible precedent. 

A 7-year-old can’t possibly make this decision or understand it. Parents should know better. I hope this father receives the public support he needs. #ProtectJamesYoungerhttps://t.co/4hszPgqGWe

Progressives, however, are trying to downplay the case. The Washington Post, for example, accepted the transgender claims and language as it wrote:

The primary victims of the transgender ideology are teens — including some who would otherwise mature into lesbian women or gay men. But there is no media focus b/c feminists & progressives want more TGs & the L&G groups are steered by transgender donors. https://t.co/bD7c8UNSZe
