Lush Cosmetics Strips Shop Windows to Protest Transgender ‘Discrimination’, Launches ‘Be an Ally’ Campaign

Lush, a popular cosmetics chain which specializes in natural, vegetarian, and vegan products, has stripped their shop windows and launched a campaign in an effort to protest “discrimination” against transgender people.

For the next two weeks, we're stripping all product from our shop windows to take a deep dive into the discrimination faced by transgender people in North America while discussing how cisgender people can be good allies. #TransRightsAreHumanRights – RT if you stand with us. pic.twitter.com/M3K1Ihdiy8

Lush Cosmetics is also selling transgender-themed “Inner Truth” bath bombs during the campaign, and distributing booklets on “how to be a trans ally,” while the company published two articles on their website: “Trans Rights are Human Rights,” and a transgender term glossary to help people use “correct, respectful language to describe transgender experiences and identities.”

100 percent of the profits from the bath bombs, excluding tax, will be donated to transgender charities.



 Your support for our #TransRightsAreHumanRights campaign has been overwhelmingly positive. So much so, that our exclusive Inner Truth bath melt has sold out online (thank you💗!). You can continue to support trans rights and other important humanitarian, environmental and animal welfare causes year round by purchasing Charity Pot Hand and Body Lotion.

 For the duration of this campaign and far, far beyond, our shops will be a safe space for transgender people. #NoHateZone #TransRightsAreHumanRights

 So amazed at all the wonderful things lush is doing ❤️ – The only reason I didn’t pick up an inner truth bath melt is because I don’t love the scent – #lush #lushfreshhandmadecosmetics💗 #innertruthbathmelt #transrightsarehumanrights #fightinganimaltesting #fightinganimalcruelty

 The stats on violence against transgender people are alarming. According to the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, 46% of trans people were verbally harassed for being trans in the year prior. Nearly one in ten have been physically attacked. The numbers for trans women of color are even worse. #TransRightsAreHumanRights
