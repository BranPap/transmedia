Woman Gives Birth to Child, Insists She Is a Man

A woman in Portland, Oregon, has birthed a healthy child, just like 4 million other American women each year.

However, local media described the mother as a man, partly because she wears a beard and says she is “transgender.”

Trystan Reese, of Portland, OR, gave birth to Leo two weeks ago. Leo is the first biological child for Reese and his husband, Biff Chaplow. The couple also have two adopted children.

“I would say it’s unique,” Reese said. “I understand that people are not used to two men having a biological child.”

Reese said the road to having a child was a difficult one. The last time he tried to get pregnant, he had a miscarriage.

Fox’s description of the mother as a man may have been caused by a willingness to agree with political activists who insist that each person’s sex is determined by their “gender identity,” not by their biology.

In this case, the mother wears a beard and claims she is a man, but she also admitted that she gave birth to the child. Also, the TV station reported that the father is Biff Chaplow, who said on camera that the birth was “a pure moment of bliss, like the happiest moment of my life.”

Fox 19 Now also reported that the child is a “biological child.” The TV station did not describe alternative types of non-biological children.

Reese’s normal birthing of her child came mid-July, shortly before local police found a man who had gone missing for several days. According to Patch.com local news service:

PORTLAND, OR — Police thanked the public for its assistance in locating a Portland man missing since June, officials announce Sunday morning.

Eric Todd McClelland, 46, was first reported missing on July 1, though his family hadn’t had contact with him since June 22, when he said he was returning home from a trip.
