NYC Episcopalian School Invited ‘Drag Queen Activist’ to ‘Teach the Children’

An Episcopalian school in blue New York City invited a drag queen to its “Pride Chapel” event earlier this year, as minors were encouraged to stand up and clap for the activist.

“Visibility matters and I’m so honored to have had the chance to talk to you about my work as a LGBTQ+ Drag Queen Activist,” he added.

The video features a masked man introducing the drag queen, urging the high school students to stand up and welcome him.

“Her name is Brita Filter, and she is the queen of New York! Yaaaaaaas!” he exclaimed in the video that has recently gone viral:

According to the school’s website, the Grace Church School focuses on integrating “ethical consciousness and academic excellence by addressing the moral, personal, and spiritual development of students,” describing itself as an “intentionally inclusive community.”

“The Episcopal school tradition recognizes the unique, intrinsic worth of every human being, bestowed upon each by a loving God,” it continues. 

The school said it intentionally attempts to instill students with a “deep respect” for not just race or religion but sexual orientation and gender identity, touting its “anti-bias” and “antiracism” programs. 

“So we said, ‘Wait a minute.’ Having kids involved in this is wrong, that is not consistent with our law and policy in the state of Florida, and it is a disturbing trend in our society to try to sexualize these young people,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) recently said of this recent trend.

“That is not the way you look out for our children,” he added.
