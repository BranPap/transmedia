This is not the only time Jenner has campaigned on her former self as Bruce Jenner.

Several weeks ago, in an email to supporters, the Jenner campaign also offered donors a signed photo featuring the candidate holding a 1976 cereal box in one hand and the other a 2016 copy of Sports Illustrated, which featured a cover photo of Caitlyn Jenner.

Liberals have been aghast at Jenner’s use of Bruce to raise campaign dollars. Leftists say the practice of bringing up a trans person’s past is an act of “deadnaming,” or the act of citing the person’s original name that has been left behind after a transition, a name that is effectively “dead.”

One person who replied to Jenner’s Wheaties box giveaway tweet pointed out the “deadnaming”:

Isn’t this called “dead naming” or something?

Another scoffed that the use of the old Bruce Jenner persona made light of Jenner’s transition, saying, “This desperate move just solidifies IMO that your transition was part personal demons but also part marketing move.”
