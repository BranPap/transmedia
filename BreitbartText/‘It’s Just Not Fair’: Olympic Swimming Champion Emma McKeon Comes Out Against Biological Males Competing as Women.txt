‘It’s Just Not Fair’: Olympic Swimming Champion Emma McKeon Comes Out Against Biological Males Competing as Women

Australian gold medal winner Emma McKeon has come out against allowing biological males to compete among biological females in sports, calling transgender athletes “not fair.”

McKeon, who recently accepted a “wild card” nomination for the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, Queensland, said she assumes she will eventually face a man claiming to be a woman.

“But now that it’s a growing thing, the sport has to think about how to handle it and how to deal with it, because you do want to be inclusive, but you don’t want to have females racing against swimmers who are biologically male because it’s just not fair,” she added.

McKeon is not the first Olympian to oppose the transgender athlete agenda late. Last year, U.S. Olympian Erika Brown said, “We cannot allow transgender females to compete against biological women.”

Former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner has also blasted transgenderism for destroying women’s sports. Jenner also said it isn’t “transphobic” to criticize transgender athletes.
