Zions Bank Retracts Sponsorship of Pride Event with Drag Kid Performances

Zions Bank, which was previously sponsoring a pride event that featured performances from drag children, has retracted its support. 

“Come and cheer them on as they bring drag to the younger generation,” the event description says. 

Zions Bank stated, “When we committed to our sponsorship of this year’s Boise Pride event, we were unaware of the event’s activities involving children/minors. Since learning of these specific activities, we have made the decision to withdraw our participation in this year’s Boise Pride event and have communicated this to the organizers.”

The event is still being sponsored by several other prominent corporations, however. CitiBank, Wells Fargo, Target, and Hewlett-Packard, for example, are all sponsoring the event. 

Similar events centered around child involvement in drag have been sponsored by other corporations in the past. Breitbart News previously revealed that Toyota sponsored an event concerning “the first steps of becoming a fabulous drag performer.”

The lessons for children featured a performer from RuPaul’s Drag Race and was hosted by the Los Angeles LGBT Center, which Toyota gives at least $100,000 to on an annual basis. Both Wells Fargo and CitiBank, as well as Bank of America, financially support the organization.
