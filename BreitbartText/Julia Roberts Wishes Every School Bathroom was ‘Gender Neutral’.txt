Julia Roberts Wishes Every School Bathroom was ‘Gender Neutral’

Hollywood actress Julia Roberts urged schools across America to make every restroom gender neutral in a social media post this week.

“I wish they all said this,” Julia Roberts captioned a photo of her standing in front of a “gender neutral restroom” sign.

The Academy Award-winner directed followers to her Instagram story where she expressed support from GLSEN, an organization that seeks to “improve an education system that too frequently allows its lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and questioning (LGBTQ) students to be bullied, discriminated against, or fall through the cracks.”

“GLSEN makes schools safe for every student no matter your sexual orientation or gender identity,” the Eat Pray Love actress said.

On top of her LGBT activism, Roberts has jumped into the political space campaigning for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election.

“Let’s, okay let’s fucking make that what goes on right now. I don’t know. I’m just saying. I’ve been dragged out here. I’m scared and tired. Oh, my kids are watching this. So for every bad mother that says the F-word—could all the mothers that relate — just five hundred bucks.”

The 51-year-old previously starred in a climate change activist ad campaign as the voice of “Mother Nature,” threatening humans, “I have fed species greater than you and I have starved species greater than you.”
