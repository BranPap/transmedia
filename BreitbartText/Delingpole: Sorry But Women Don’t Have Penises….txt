Delingpole: Sorry But Women Don’t Have Penises…

“Women don’t have penises.”

The city’s mayor has promised to “work with police” to track down and “identify” those responsible for spreading this hateful, transphobic message.

I am not aware of the group, we will remove stickers and work with the Police to identify those responsible. Remember though,Liverpool takes #PRIDE in its diversity and history of fighting for equality for all, we love all our Trans residents and all our LGBT community😘😍🙏 https://t.co/YJdsA6uXXo

The group has been handing out stickers to this effect.

Aw, baby stickers! #StickerWoman pic.twitter.com/r1cWuo3zSG

But now, after complaints by the usual suspects, the Mayor – and apparently the city’s police too – have chosen to take the side of the transgender activists.

Hi, thanks for the tag, I can confirm we are aware of this matter and enquiries are being made.

One of the few good things that can be said for the insanely aggressive (because they’re all men, basically) transgender rights movement is the division it has caused in the feminist movement. On the principle of ‘my enemy’s enemy is my friend’ it’s quite refreshing to find, for a change, in the foxhole next to me a bunch of TERFs (Trans-exclusionary radical feminists) fighting alongside a sexist pig like myself – and doing so with that admirable, no prisoners commitment one has come to expect from feminists.

The TERFs are right of course. Women don’t have penises. It’s a scientific fact. To argue otherwise is to deny biological reality.

As the Queen of TERFs, Germaine Greer once trenchantly put it:

“Just because you lop off your penis and then wear a dress doesn’t make you a fucking woman. I’ve asked my doctor to give me long ears and liver spots and I’m going to wear a brown coat but that won’t turn me into a fucking cocker spaniel.

If she said this in Liverpool today she would presumably run the risk of arrest.

Brendan O’Neill, as usual, is spot on here:

Consider what is being done here. Not only are the police making enquiries about the expression of an idea, which is something they should never do; but even worse, they are making enquiries about speech that simply said, ‘Women do not have penises’. But that is true. Or, to make a tiny concession to this era of relativism, this statement is considered by very many people to be true. If you have a penis, you are male. If you have a vagina, you are female. Of course people with penises should be at liberty to call themselves women and change their names and so on – but that doesn’t mean the rest of us have to accept that they really are women. They clearly are not.
