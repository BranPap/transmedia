Bruce Jenner: Donald Trump ‘Would Be Very Good for Women’s Issues,’ Hillary Clinton a ‘F–king Liar’

Bruce “Caitlyn” Jenner unloads on Hillary Clinton on this Sunday’s episode of “I Am Cait,” calling the Democratic presidential frontrunner a “f**king liar” and added the “country is over” if she’s elected.

When asked about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Jenner says, “I’m not a big fan because I think of his macho attitude. I think he would have a hard time with women when he doesn’t even realize it, and it doesn’t mean he wouldn’t be good for women’s issues.”



The 66-year-old transgender icon didn’t pull punches when asked to reveal thoughts about Hillary Clinton.

“Oh my God, yes, I would never ever ever vote for Hillary,” Jenner screams. “We’re done, if Hillary becomes president — the country is over.”

Hillary Clinton is a “f–king liar,” Jenner said, adding that the former secretary of state is a “political hack.”

“You want a person that’s going to lie to you?” Jenner asked. “She’s a political hack. That’s all she is. She’s done nothing!”
