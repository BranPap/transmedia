Horror Movie ‘They/Them’ Director: ‘Shows How Heroic and How Wonderful Queer People Are’

Any hope that the new horror movie They/Them will portray the pronoun crowd as the monsters they are will be immediately dashed upon reading recent interviews promoting the Blumhouse production.

Bacon described the young characters in the movie as the “future.”

“It’s tough to find hope sometimes these days, but we have to hope still,” he told ET Canada at the premiere. “The one thing that we can be hopeful about is that there are young people like the people in this movie who are the future.”

Reviews for They/Them have been largely negative so far, with critics saying the movie is both muddled in its self-conscious message and dull as an exercise in horror.
