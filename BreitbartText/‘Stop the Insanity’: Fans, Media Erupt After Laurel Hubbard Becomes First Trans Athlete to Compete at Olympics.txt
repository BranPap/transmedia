‘Stop the Insanity’: Fans, Media Erupt After Laurel Hubbard Becomes First Trans Athlete to Compete at Olympics

Reactions are piling up after it was reported that the International Olympics Committee had approved Laurel Hubbard, a male who identifies as a woman, to become the first trans athlete to compete in the Olympics.

Hubbard’s inclusion at the Tokyo games has engendered much criticism.

Belgian Olympian Anna Vanbellinghen, for instance, said it is a “bad joke” that Hubbard will advance to the Olympics as a female contestant.

The group Save Women’s Sports Australasia also spoke out about the IOC’s “flawed policy” that would allow Hubbard to compete as a female.

“It is flawed policy from the IOC that has allowed the selection of a 43-year-old biological male who identifies as a woman to compete in the female category,” the group declared after the announcement.

Sharron Davies, a female British Olympian who has been outspoken on the issue of trans athletes, voiced her dissent in response to the IOC’s decision, among others:

We have men &women’s separate competition 4a BIG reason, biology in sport matters. Separate categories give females equal opportunities of sporting success, the average age of a female Olympic weight lifter is 23. Laurel Hubbard is 43. 30% unfair advantage! Sex not gender 4Sport https://t.co/CN8bdniKrq

Totally fair.

Test: explain, precisely, why there are separate categories for men’s & women’s sports? 

Why not just have generic “basketball” & “tennis” & “track” & “weightlifting,” regardless of gender?

If you have a problem with that, explain why, exactly. https://t.co/6CKUQNxSdE

Laurel Hubbard has literally prevented a 'cisgender woman' from fulfilling her dream of competing at the Olympics. What more evidence do you need? https://t.co/f8z01LbmKe

*NEW COLUMN*Allowing a transgender weightlifter to compete in the Tokyo Olympics is a terrible mistake that destroys women’s rights to equality and fairness – and will kill the Olympic dream for female athletes.https://t.co/VfMeXv4m2J pic.twitter.com/mK4nsorQYV

No offence to Laurel Hubbard or the trans-community but this makes me angry every time it comes up. 

NZ have so many sporting achievements to be proud of but this tarnishes our reputation BIG TIME 👎🏽https://t.co/dz6lHgbdja

A 43 year old transgender woman will be representing New Zealand in Olympic weightlifting next month and has a strong chance to win a medal. This is how women’s sports die: https://t.co/wMdUYnCGp8

Laurel Hubbard is the first transgender athlete to compete in Olympics

Democrats argue laws restricting Colleges to only letting people play sports based upon their biological sex b/c it isn’t something that occurs.

Remember these cases. Is this fair?https://t.co/vfi1w7TF2s

For the sake of our daughters and female athletes worldwide, we must stop this insanity.

It takes balls to deprive someone of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity by pretending you’re a woman when everyone knows you’re not. If the other athletes have any sense they’ll refuse to compete.https://t.co/GHSKfFXOmi

This simply isn't fair.https://t.co/jfqrAJprIu

This is not progressive. #LaurelHubbard competed in men's sport until 2013 and will now compete in women's events at the Olympics. If you can change from one category to the other, why do we have separate categories at all? https://t.co/NRe3ctnm4w
