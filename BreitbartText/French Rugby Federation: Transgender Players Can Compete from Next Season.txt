French Rugby Federation: Transgender Players Can Compete from Next Season

PARIS (AP) – The French rugby federation is allowing transgender people to take part in all France’s domestic competitions from next season in a move going against recommendations from World Rugby.

The French federation issued a statement saying its executive board unanimously voted in favour of the transgender proposal from its Anti-Discrimination and Equal Treatment Commission.

“Rugby is an inclusive, sharing sport, without distinction of sex, gender, origin or religion,” said Serge Simon, the vice-president of the French rugby federation. “It is important to allow all our members to practice their passion while respecting everyone’s rights.”

Under the new recommendations, the French federation said that transgender people “physically reassigned and recognized in their current gender” can play in all its official competitions. Those transitioning to their new sexual identity need to provide proof their civil record has changed.

Transgender people transitioning from male to female should also demonstrate that they have been undergoing hormonal treatment for at least 12 months.
