Michelle Rodriguez Cast To Play Transgender Hitman/Hitwoman/Hitperson

Fast and the Furious co-star Michelle Rodriguez has been cast to star as a transgender hitperson in director Walter Hill’s upcoming action thriller Tomboy, A Revenger’s Tale, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

The industry news site reports Rodriguez will star as a male-turned female assassin in the film, alongside Sigourney Weaver, whose character is described as a rogue surgeon known as “The Doctor,” who turns Rodriguez’s character into a woman.

The hitman, who at this point is a hitwoman, then sets out for revenge, and is aided by a nurse named Johnnie, who also has “secrets.”

The film’s script was written by Walter Hill, and adapted from a story by author Denis Hamill, per THR.

No release date has been set.
