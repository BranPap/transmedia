Female Swimmer: Stop Woke Sports, Put Transgenders in Men’s Races

Linda Blade, a former swimmer and sports performance coach, has responded to support for Lia Thomas, a “transgender woman” who is competing against female athletes.

Lucas Draper, a junior-year swimmer at Oberlin College, wrote an earlier oped in Swimming World defending Thomas, which Blade said “rang hollow” and “missed [the] point of controversy.”

First, Blade praises Draper for competing against men instead of continuing to compete as a woman “while doping,” referring to hormone treatments. But Draper’s comments “deploy escalating levels of emotional gaslighting.”

Blade broke down her response into five points:

Blade calls on the NCAA to revisit its 2011 rules that allow sports participation based on gender identity not biological sex.

“Given the overwhelming scientific evidence now available showing that males will always maintain a physical advantage over females in sports involving strength, speed, power and reaction time, the NCAA must undertake a re-assessment of its policy ASAP!”
