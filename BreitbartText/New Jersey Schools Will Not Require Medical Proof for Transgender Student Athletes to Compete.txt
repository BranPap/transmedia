New Jersey Schools Will Not Require Medical Proof for Transgender Student Athletes to Compete

The association that governs school athletics in New Jersey says it will not require a doctor’s note, or any other type of proof, to allow transgender students to compete against students competing within their assigned gender at birth.

The policy statement released this week defines a transgender student as “a student whose gender identity differs from the student’s sex assigned at birth” and notes such students “shall be eligible to participate with either their birth sex or in accordance with their gender identity, but not both.”

But, nowhere in the policy statement does it require any proof from a student’s medical provider that the student is undergoing any care to transition from one gender to another.

Additionally, the policy allows students to use banned substances if they are required for hormone therapy. And while the policy states that a medical review officer may consider the use of the banned drugs, it still does not maintain that a student’s medical providers must prove the need for such drugs nor does the policy lay out a process for the medical review officer to make a decision.

NJSIAA attorney Steve Goodell told the media that the policy was released after prodding from LGBT activists.

But, the Christian Post notes that in a June column, Heather Zeiger was skeptical of these sort of policies and worried that girls would be eliminated from female sports if men claiming to be women begin competing as females.

“Women will, in effect, be pushed out of competition because they were born with female bodies,” Zeiger wrote. “Does that make any sense? As Jeff Jacobs asks in his thoughtful article in the Hartford Courant, ‘What do we tell these girls? A transgender’s journey is more important than your journey?'”
