Bruce Jenner Lobbying for Trans Performer to Win Best Supporting Actress Oscar

Bruce Jenner is leading an Oscar campaign for transgender performer Mya Taylor, who might be in contention for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar at the upcoming Academy Awards, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Tangerine was shot entirely using iPhone 5s and premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. The film stars trans actresses Kitana “Kiki” Rodriguez and Taylor.

Speaking to TheWrap about the film’s Oscar prospects recently, Baker said he hopes Taylor and Rodriguez are recognized for their work on Tangerine and would like to see the pair move on to play other roles.

“Now that more trans roles are being written, it’s time to look at trans actors who can play these roles,” Baker said.

On whether or not the Academy should create a new category specifically to recognize trans performers, the director said, “No, I don’t think so.”

…I never understood the gender breakdown in the Oscar campaigns anyway. The best thespian should win the award. This is how I see it — Mya and Kiki are women and they should be recognized as women, so if those gender-based categories exist then they should be nominated under the Best Actress category.

Tangerine co-stars Taylor as 24-year-old Alexandra, an LA-area sex worker whose best friend Sin-Dee (Rodriguez) is released from prison. Sin-Dee returns home and enlists Alexandra’s help in finding the source of a “scandalous rumor” on Christmas Eve.

Taylor received the best breakthrough actor/actress Gotham Award on Nov. 30.
