Report: Iran Forcing Gays and Lesbians into Gender Reassignment Surgery



In an extensive BBC report, a number of Iranian gays and lesbians currently living in exile tell tales of public pressure to undergo gender reassignment surgery. Many, the report notes, begin feeling outside pressure to change their gender as early as age 16– when the idea of having a medical procedure fix all social problems may seem especially appealing. 

“I was under so much pressure that I wanted to change my gender as soon as possible,” says Donya, a lesbian who fled to Turkey to avoid the surgery. She underwent hormone therapy and said she felt better with herself, but after extensive research, found that the surgery was not for her. “I got to know myself better… I accepted that I was a lesbian and I was happy with that,” she tells BBC.

A psychologist interviewed by the BBC explains that the pressure is not always in the form of threats of violence, but instead positive offerings: “They show how easy it can be… They promise to give you legal documents and, even before the surgery, permission to walk in the street wearing whatever you like. They promise to give you a loan to pay for the surgery.” 

This has swayed a number of leftist groups to support Iran’s unofficial policies, which at first glance appear to embrace transgender individuals and constitute a progressive attitude towards sexuality. In 2005, for example, the progressive journal Salon published a column describing Iran as the “global leader for sex changes,” praising the Ayatollah’s edict on transgender individuals as having “provided deliverance to a community that was once cowed and confined to a secret underground existence.”
