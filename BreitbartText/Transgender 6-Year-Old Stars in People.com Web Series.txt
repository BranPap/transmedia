Transgender 6-Year-Old Stars in People.com Web Series

In a frightening sign of how even the youngest of children can now be exploited by gender-confused fanatics, six-year-old Devina Keswani—originally named Dev and born male but now assuming the role of female—is starring in a new web series created for People.com: The Keswanis: A Most Modern Family.

The parents live in a world all their own—in the third episode of the series, Vaishali insists, “The day Dev could walk, the walk was feminine. The day Dev could talk, it was really feminine.”

A kindergarten teacher set the parents straight, telling them that one of the child’s assignments indicated something might be awry. The parents then discussed the situation with their kindergarten child. According to People, “the family realized they couldn’t deny Devina’s true self any longer.”

Vaishali hardly hesitated; “It took me about 30 seconds to take that in. I just wrapped my arms around her and said ‘You will never have to be Dev again, ever.'”

Now Devina hangs out with “peers,” such as Lily Rubenstein, a transgender 15-year-old. Rubenstein pontificated, “Family support is the number one way to ensure that your child will have a happy and healthy transition. The Keswanis are setting the example here. Because of their support, Devina has been able to live a happy and authentic life. There is nothing better than being able to do that.”

Devina claims in the series that a transgenderphobic boy bullied Devina. The child has also joined the Girl Scouts. In the series, Devina plans to speak at school about transgenderism.

Meanwhile, Anil attended a photoshoot for Sarina, claiming he felt uncomfortable when she was told to be “young sexy.”

Vaishali admits, “That is not your normal American family. It’s not necessarily how we envisioned our life to be, but it’s a life that’s so full and rich.”
