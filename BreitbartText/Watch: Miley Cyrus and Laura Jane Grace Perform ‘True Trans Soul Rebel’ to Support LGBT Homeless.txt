Watch: Miley Cyrus and Laura Jane Grace Perform ‘True Trans Soul Rebel’ to Support LGBT Homeless

Miley Cyrus released the fourth video in her “Backyard Sessions” on Saturday, enlisting Laura Jane Grace and Atom Willard of Against Me! for an acoustic rendition of the punk band’s “True Trans Soul Rebel.”



“True Trans Soul Rebel,” off of Against Me!’s acclaimed 2014 album Transgender Dysphoria Blues, details a trans person’s struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts. For the acoustic version, Cyrus takes a backseat, letting Grace do most of the work and contributing backup vocals on the chorus.

Cyrus unveiled the first video in the Backyard Sessions last week. The singer teamed up with rocker Joan Jett for a version of the Blackhearts’s song “Different.”

The second video in the series featured Cyrus’s take on Dido’s track “No Freedom,” while the third video saw the Bangerz singer team up with Jett and Grace for a cover of the Replacements’s “Androgynous.”

Cyrus has been vocal in her support of LGBT causes. In August, she sent a homeless teen to accept an MTV Video Music Award on her behalf, and earlier this year, she called Indiana Gov. Mike Pence an “a**hole” for signing the Indiana Religious Freedom and Restoration Act.
