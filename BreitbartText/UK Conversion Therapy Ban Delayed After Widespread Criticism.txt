UK Conversion Therapy Ban Delayed After Widespread Criticism

A proposed ban on conversion therapy in the United Kingdom has been delayed after widespread criticism from religious and medical professionals.

According to a post on an official government website, the reason for the extension is “to ensure anyone who has not yet responded” to the request for consultation “has the opportunity to do so”.

However, according to The Telegraph, officials simply had not anticipated how “sensitive and complex” issues surrounding the ban are, being “shocked” by some of the responses.

“It shouldn’t be illegal for Christians to teach their faith, or for people to pray for their friends,” argues the Christian Institute. “But that’s clearly what the campaigners want.”

It is also feared that the law may interfere with medical professionals dealing with children who may be experiencing gender dysphoria, legally preventing them from doing anything but affirming that a child is transgender.

In turn, it is feared that this change will lead to an increase in the number of young people undergoing irreversible medical treatment.

Esses welcomed the decision to extend the consultation, saying that the law deserves “due care and attention”.

Despite the delay over the long list of concerns, according to the government webpage, ministers remain “determined to stamp out conversion therapy”.

As the Conservative party battles with banning gay and transgender conversion therapy, other concerns have been raised regarding how trans ideology is impacting medical care for children.

He also claims that the zealous nature with which the health service designates patients as trans is putting children on track for invasive surgeries with “virtually no psychological scrutiny at all”.
