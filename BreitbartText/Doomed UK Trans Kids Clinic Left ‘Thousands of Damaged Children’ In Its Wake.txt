Doomed UK Trans Kids Clinic Left ‘Thousands of Damaged Children’ In Its Wake

The Tavistock Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS), England’s hub for child gender reassignment which has been ordered to close down, is said to have left “thousands of damaged children” in its wake.

Reports by outlets such as The Telegraph are now looking back on 18 years of whistleblowing and complaints about the National Health Service (NHS) clinic and the way it resisted all efforts to make it change its ways all the way up to the High Court.

The notionally right-leaning newspaper recalled how whistleblower Susan Evans had been fobbed off as long ago as 2004 after expressing worry that a 16-year-old boy had been referred for hormones after a mere four appointments. Another concerned clinician, Kirsty Entwistle, was branded “transphobic” for questioning the fact that an autistic girl enjoying Thomas the Tank Engine was used as evidence that she was trans.

Evans also highlighted the “tremendous pressure” the Tavistock was put under by trans activist lobby groups such as the controversial Mermaids organisation, which has campaigned for puberty blockers to be given to 12-year-olds and argued dubiously that their effects are “completely reversible”.

“We have a responsibility to those under 18 to shield them from irreversible decisions that will affect them for the rest of their lives. As Prime Minister, I would review access to puberty blockers to ensure we are maintaining the right checks and balances in the system to protect our young people,” said Truss, somewhat equivocally.

Sunak’s position was a little more forthright, with a spokesman for the former Chancellor of the Exchequer saying that “[c]hildren should not be rushed down irreversible medical pathways, and under-18s should be protected from life-altering treatments.”
