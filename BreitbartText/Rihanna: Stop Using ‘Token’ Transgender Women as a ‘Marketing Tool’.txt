Rihanna: Stop Using ‘Token’ Transgender Women as a ‘Marketing Tool’

Rihanna called on companies to stop using “token” transgender women as a “marketing tool,” during an alleged private message to a fan this week.

“I’ve had the pleasure of working with many gifted trans women throughout the years, but I don’t go around doing trans castings! Just like I don’t do straight non trans women castings!” wrote Rihanna in a private Twitter message to a fan, after they asked her to include a trans woman in her campaign. “I respect all women, and whether they’re trans or not is none of my business! It’s personal and some trans women are more comfortable being open about it than others so I have to respect that as a woman myself!”

Last week, Barbie attempted to turn the LGBT community into its marketing department by publishing photographs of two “Love Wins” dolls to their Instagram account.
