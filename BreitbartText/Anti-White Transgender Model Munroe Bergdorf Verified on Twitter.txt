Anti-White Transgender Model Munroe Bergdorf Verified on Twitter

A transgender model who was fired from her job at L’Oreal following a racist rant against white people has been verified on Twitter, despite the platform’s announcement that it would no longer verify people who engage in racism.

ὄ look who's verified. Shout out to Twitter for pushing that through :)

“Honestly I don’t have energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more. Yes ALL white people,” wrote Bergdorf on Facebook. “Because most of ya’ll don’t even realise or refuse to acknowledge that your existence, privilege and success as a race is built on the backs, blood and death of people of colour. Your entire existence is drenched in racism. From micro-aggression to terrorism, you guys built the blueprint for this shit.”

“Come see me when you realise that racism isn’t learned, it’s inherited and consciously or unconsciously passed down through privilege,” the model continued, adding, “Once white people begin to admit that their race is the most violent and oppressive force of nature on Earth… then we can talk.”

“Until then stay acting shocked about how the world continues to stay fucked at the hands of your ancestors and your heads that remain buried in the sand with hands over your ears,” she concluded.

In November, several popular conservative accounts were stripped of their Twitter verification, including anti-Islam activist and author Tommy Robinson and commentator Laura Loomer.

Twitter also stripped prominent alt-right accounts of their account verification, including Richard Spencer and James Allsup, and declared that accounts could now lose their verification for “promoting hate,” or “directly attacking” people “on the basis of race.”

Days later, the platform announced its intentions to start sanctioning users for their offline behavior too.

Though Twitter maintains its claims that account verification is a way to let “people know that an account of public interest is authentic,” prominent individuals such as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange remain unverified on the platform.
