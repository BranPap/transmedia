Bette Midler: Bruce Jenner Is ‘Uninformed’ for Voting Republican

Actress/singer Bette Midler is going after Bruce Jenner, after the transgender activist announced he intends to vote Republican in the upcoming presidential election.

After watching the Nov. 14 Democratic primary debate at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, Jenner told The Los Angeles Times that the Democrats “didn’t convince me” to vote for them.

People, #CaitlynJenner says she is STILL voting GOP in2016. Regardless of gender identity, I guess she identifies most as "uninformed."

“People, #CaitlynJenner says she is STILL voting GOP in2016. Regardless of gender identity, I guess she identifies most as “uninformed,” Midler wrote.

Jenner faced criticism in September, when the father of six told Ellen DeGeneres he wasn’t sold on same-sex marriage.

“Gay marriage… I’m a traditionalist. I’m older than most people in the audience. I kind of like tradition, and it’s always been a man and a woman,” he said.

The reality TV star told Diane Sawyer in April, “I’ve always been more on the conservative side.”

He added, “I believe in the Constitution.”
