# Linguistic Strategies of Delegitimization and Demonization: A Case Study of Transgender Identities on the American Far Right

## About the Project

This project aims to investigate how the Alt-/Far-Right in the United States uses language in order to denigrate and delegitimize trans* people and identities. In particular, I am concerned with how agency is employed by the American Right to construct and perpetuate dominant transphobic narratives of predation, transgression, and mental illness.
